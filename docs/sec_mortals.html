<h1 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">Mortals</h1>

<div id="p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The majority of sapient species on Inannak are bound by the laws of death, an ancient law written into the fabric of the universe. These species are called mortals. The law of death requires a living creature to age and eventually die, so that their soul travels to the underworld. Plants and beasts of Inannak are also bound by the law of death, but the term mortal usually refers to sapient peoples. This section describes most of the well-known mortal species of Inannak.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Most sapient mortals are believed to descend from a single species, who lived on Inannak long ago. However, after eons of life under the dragons, titans and the hebdomad, they have been divided into numerous species.</p>
</div>
<section id="SS1" class="ltx_subsection">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">The Eight Liberated Species</h2>

<div id="SS1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Most of the mortals of Inannak belong to one of the eight species who were once subject to the hebdomad. Before the Mortal War, they knew themselves as the Vassal Species. Since the war and the defeat of the hebdomad, they call themselves the Liberated Species. Each of these groups was subject to one deity in the hebdomad, known as their patron. It is unknown whether those deities raised these species out of earlier mortals, or took species already existing as they were. It may be a mix of both.</p>
</div>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Elves</h3>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The Älveen, called Elves in Freetongue, are a diverse group. Their legends speak of having emerged from the underground, and some of them have returned there. They were the people of the Sabowth, the War King, who raised the High Elves as leaders over all of them. There is some evidence that the Elves have Oneirian blood. Sabowth had divided the Älveen into a number of castes. The prejudices each caste has for each other remain despite the banishment of Sabowth centuries ago. The separation of the castes also gave them distinctive appearances over the millennia. Elves live in small communities, even among the most civilized, preferring to surround their villages and fortresses with natural wilderness for protection. These are the primary castes.</p>
</div>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px1" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Council Elves</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Äľveiün</span>) Sabowth’s personal council, a small set of less than a dozen families, ruled over all the Elves, and by their reckoning, all mortals. They were loyal to Sabowth until the very end, and only a few remain today. These are often considered part of the High Elves.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px2" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">High Elves</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Äľvepähüülhän</span>) The High Elves were the nobility, military officers, and wealthiest merchants. The majority of these remained loyal to Sabowth during the Mortal War. Since the Mortal War, High Elves, whether they remained loyal or not, have become pariahs. This has led to a harsh political division between them and the other Elves.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px3" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Wood Elves</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Äľveshüchiin</span>) The Wood Elves were the priests and scholars. Sabowth, in what some High Elves considered a mistake, allowed this group a sense of freedom of scholarship and thought. Thus, the philosophies of the early apostasy were well known in their circles. As they also had close contact with their lesser brethren and saw how they were treated under the hebdomad, many were quick to side with the rebellion when it began. The name “wood elf” does not come from any affiliation with wood or forests, but a metaphor: if Elvendom were a forest, the wood elves make up the trees, while the high elves are the leaves. This metaphor ignores the gnomes, firbolgs and goblins.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px4" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Deep Elves</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px4.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Öijhärüün</span>) Years ago, perhaps before the God War, groups of elves descended, to cavern complexes deep in the underneath. Sabowth still ruled over these elves, but allowed them their own hierarchies of authority. As groups of gnomes and goblins also joined them, they became the Äľveiün of the underground. However, during the Mortal War, most took the side of the apostasy.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px5" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Gnomes</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Ngomeen</span>) The gnomes were the craftsmen, tradesmen, and lesser merchants. Many of this caste lived and worked in underground complexes, but there were just as many who lived in the forests. Certain groups of gnomes, called Deep Gnomes, descended with the Deep Elves underground long ago, and their descendants are still occasionally seen.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px6" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Firbolgs</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fiirböľghön</span>) The Firbolgs were farmers and herdsmen. The firbolgs tended to live in more remote areas near their fields or herds. This meant they were often separated from the rest of the Älveen, creating differences in needs and custom.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS1.SSSx1.Px7" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Goblins</h4>

<div id="SS1.SSSx1.Px7.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Ghöbľeen</span>) This was the lowest caste of the Älveen, and were used as laborers and common soldiers. In Inannak, Goblins are not silly and dumb, as that is only a stereotype of their caste. From this caste, Sabowth pulled out two groups for special jobs.</p>

<div id="SS1.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Gnoles are hairy humanoids with long snouts and sharp teeth. Their appearance varies greatly, but depending on their family and nation their faces can be reminiscent of canine or feline animals. They are carnivores, and known to be easily incited into violence and war. Before the Mortal Wars, this trait was encouraged by their patron Ildabowth, as well as the rest of the hebdomad. Ildabowth enjoyed sowing chaos in the ordered civilizations of the other mortals, and his siblings would often use his mortals’ services as a threat to keep the mortals in place. Ildabowth’s mastery of the underworld made it possible for the Gnoles to move from place to place unseen through caverns underground.</p>
</div>
<div id="SS1.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">As the apostasy began to spread to the Gnoles through interaction with humans, an occult religious movement began to emerge among the Gnoles who sought to tame their fury and use it for making the world better and bringing peace. It was this cult that initiated the first successful rebellion that began the Mortal War. Since the war, the Gnole apostacists movement continues to grow. Although it is not rising without conflict – there are still many Gnoles loyal to Ildabowth, even dead – it has garnered some respect and redemption for the Gnole’s past in the eyes of other mortals.</p>

Although raised up among the mortals by Oria, Lady of the Bow, as master hunters, she enjoyed watching them form themselves into complex and unique societies – as long as she retained final control. The freedom that she allowed them was a major factor leading to the apostasy. There are too many human nations to list here. </p>

<p class="ltx_p">Eilwain, She Who Knows, was more careful in the design for her mortals. While others stuck with the flesh and bipedal form that mortals already had, she designed her people with more efficiency and more durability. She gave them the shape of insects, giving them extra limbs to work and fight with. She gave them hard armor plating for protection, and taught them many spells to help them assist her. Eilwain understood that freedom of choice and thought would lead to rebellion and dispute, so she gave them a psychic connection to each other that would make independent thought difficult.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">During the Mortal War, the Mantids fought for Eilwain with great loyalty, until they didn’t. The apostasy found ways to speak with the Great Queens of the Mantids and convince them of their cause, and once they were convinced so were their hive mates. Eilwain’s armies were cut by two thirds, and as the Mantids dismantled her constructs she knew her doom was imminent, and she took her own life. </p>

The Orghu are generally larger than other mortals, and many have quite unique features of appearance. They are known for their artistic traditions, ingrained into them by Atton, especially arts of performance: music, dancing and drama. Atton likes entertainment, and in addition to performances, he enjoyed watching his people fight each other in his arenas, which means Orghu culture is no stranger to violence. Atton grouped the Orghu into five peoples.</p>

But she bade them travel among the other mortals as traders and vagabonds. For she could choose to see through any of their eyes and hear through their ears to follow the workings of mortal society. This power was known as Eow’s Gaze, and there is some evidence that Eow was also able to use it with willing mortals of other species.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Before the Mortal Wars, the Saurians were seen as spies by the other mortals, and the apostasy and rebellions avoided contact with them.

Their own cities are made of large underground burrows, or neat wooden huts build on tree branches in forests. During the Mortal War, the Shirrwern at first fought loyally under Astaffe.

These stocky humanoids with skin of stone come from an isolated hive of caverns deep in the underneath. Their hive is known as the source of many valuable minerals which eventually arrive in the markets on the surface. But they only trade with their neighbors underground, so their miners are almost never seen. It is said that Ildabowth came to them long ago to claim them as his own.

Their origin is unclear, some suggest they are descended from Oneirians and mortals, others that these were mortals who used magic to hide from the titans, and then later the hebdomad. They are found almost all over the world, but prefer to live far from populous areas, hiding their small villages in natural settings: beneath tall grass, among tree tops, or in underground burrows. Magic is taught as part of their way of life, and they use a lot of it to hide and protect themselves from mortals and gods who would do them harm. During the Mortal War, most fairies maintained neutrality to both sides out of fear of notice by one side or the other. But individual fairies were recorded as being helpful against the hebdomad.

The rebels were forced to hide from Sabowth in order to escape, and they found ways to hide in plain sight. In addition to caves and mines, they’ve also been known to stow away in ships, and hide in hidden places in mortal cities and villages. Kobolds were often forced to steal food to survive, but would pay for that food by completing small household tasks. As they grew bolder from their survival, they began to sabotage places and things important to Sabowth, and later the rest of the hebdomad. They became an important resource for the rebellion during the Mortal War, as they knew how to get into places and where to get information.

However, she would have had to take away their flight, as she felt it wasn’t right for a vassal to have such an ability.

Their clawed hands and feet are webbed for better swimming in the swamp. Unlike other humanoids, the peghroads are nocturnal. They are carnivorous, and have been known to hunt other thinking creatures for food or mystical purposes. During Astaffe’s last days, she claimed the Peghroads as hers after many of the Shirrwen had abandoned her, and they fought loyally against those who would take her.

The mortal descendants of such a union will have traits that resemble their ancestry: Chthonian ancestry may provide horns or unusual skin, Ouranian ancestry may give them a slight glow, Oneirian ancestry an otherworldly appearance, and so forth.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The Oneirian daimons have an unusual practice of replacing mortal children at young ages with their own kind. Both individuals are called changelings. The Oneirian replacement remains an immortal daimon, and will often eventually join their kin in the dream world. But the mortal hostage will often gain unusual traits from their time among the daimons, and although most remain among the Oneirians, some escape or otherwise gain their freedom and attempt to return to mortal socieity.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Magical Transformations</h2>

<div id="SS5.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">As magic exists on Inannak, there are the occasional accidents and experiments of wizardry that bring about more unique creatures. Sometimes they’re a regular mortal transformed somehow, other times they are created by recipe. None of these creatures occur naturally, they are not born with these characteristics. Not that they couldn’t have been transformed at birth, however.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Construct</h3>

<div id="SS5.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Constructs are machines that have been given a semblance of life by some powerful magic. Most are mindless, and complete their ordered tasks without comment. However, the magics that create them sometimes draw a lesser daimon into the machine, giving it some sort of sapience. Generally, the shock of the transformation removes any memory the daimon had of its previous life. On rare occasions, constructs are made of the corpses of the dead, which gives them the shadow of undeath.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Therianthropy is a disease said to have been created by Oria as a way to improve her hunters. The disease allows its mortal victims to transform into one of a number of beasts. Once the disease fully takes hold, the transformation is involuntary, occurring during the period of the full moon of Oria. Victims also lose their abilities to reason and quickly become angry and violent. Only victims who have lived with the disease for a long time are able to develop coping mechanisms that allow them to control the transformation and their emotions. Therianthropy is not hereditary, although it can be transferred in the womb. Different strains of therianthropy cause transformations into different beasts: wolves, bears, tigers, cats and rats are most well known.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection">Alien Peoples</h2>

<div id="SS6.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The world of Inannak is sealed off from other multiverses. However, it is a universe, and there are other worlds than the land, sea and Underneath of Inannak. Occasionally, intelligent people from the stars or beyond appear on Inannak. Such mortals have no memory of their past, or at least no knowledge that will disrupt the history of the world. This may be the work of some unknown god, or a curse laid by the hebdomad. </p>
</div>
<div id="SS6.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">There are not enough of a population of most of these alien mortals to discuss them in depth. The chance is low of two such creatures finding themselves at the same time and place on Inannak, so families and villages of these creatures are not heard of. But if there is a people that you wish to use in your own journeys through this world, and it doesn’t seem to fit with the rest, you may add it as an alien. Keep in mind the required amnesia, and the potential culture shock when interacting with other mortals. That shock which may not be as powerful as you’d think considering the diversity of life already found on Inannak.</p>
</div>
<div id="SS6.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">There are two notable groups of alien peoples that should be mentioned.</p>
</div>
<section id="SS6.SSSx1" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Strangers</h3>

<div id="SS6.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Sometimes, people of Inannak may use the term “stranger” with an almost audible capital ’S’. This term refers to a type of alien creature which is not originally native to Inannak, but which has established a small presence here. Most of these peoples come from places beyond the stars, worlds which do not have suns, and thus they prefer to live in the Underneath, or in the ocean. Some of them may have Tromian ancestry. Notable Strangers of Inannak include the legendary Eye Beasts, the Horrors of the Depths, and the Thought Slicers. Some of these peoples are as long-lived and powerful as dragons, and might fit better into the immortal category.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="SS6.SSSx2" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Strangelings</h3>

<div id="SS6.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Strangers can not breed with other mortals, and rarely have any reason to try. However, mortals may be changed by their experiences with them. For example: slaves of Thought Slicers and Eye Lords change over generations. Their descendants, if they gain their freedom, may develop unusual physical traits such as tentacles, or psychic abilities gained from defending their thoughts against their masters’ abuses. Strangelings might also be descendants of mortals that have been removed from the physical world and survived for several generations in other worlds.</p>
