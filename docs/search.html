This chapter is an explanation of the structure of the universe.\n\n\nWorld of Mortals\n\n\nThe world of mortals is the physical world of Inannak, the place where mortal life proceeds, and where the beings of power fight for control of them and that physical world. This place is also known as the World of the Body, or the Physical World.\n\n\nThere are three parts to the world:\n\n\nThe Land and Seas\n\n\nThis band where most mortal peoples and other creatures live is a shell of ground and water around the world of Inannak. The Land and the Seas are connected in all directions, forming a sphere. This sphere lay at the center of the universe, with all heavenly bodies rotating around it.\n\n\n\nThe Underneath\n\n\nBeneath the land and the seas is the world of dirt, rock and other earthly dangers. The underneath is filled with a massive network of caves and giant caverns. These are accessible through caves on the ground. Many mortals and other creatures live in these caves. But the rock itself is home to elementals of earth and other solids, some of whom make there homes in even larger caverns separated from the caves of the underneath. Pockets of molten rock are also the homes of elementals of fire and other energies. Some scholars suggest that the underneath is layered in the same way as the sky, but what the differences between these layers are is unclear.\n\n\n\nThe Sky\n\n\nAbove the land is the sky. A few creatures fly through the lower parts of the sky, but few creatures have any desire to attempt the vast emptiness beyond. The sky is layered in spheres of crystalline air that rotate around Inannak. There are several kinds of spheres:\n\n\nThe Sphere of Clouds\n\n\nThe lowest sphere is the place where the clouds float, and from whence the rain comes. This sphere is the primary home to the elementals of air and other gases, although they can be found in many of the other spheres as well.\n\n\n\nThe Spheres of the Moons\n\n\nThese two spheres are mostly empty and black, except that each holds the great disk of a moon. Each disk is a flat world of its own, although both are barren. At least the moon Oria has oceans of its own, while the moon Eilwain is full of sands and bare rock.\n\n\n\nThe Sphere of the Sun\n\n\nThis bright sphere is divided into two parts, the daylight side is bright and blue, and the other half as black as the other spheres. At the center of the bright side is the sun, a great ball of light, which is also home to the elementals of fire and other energies.\n\n\n\nThe Spheres of the Planets\n\n\nMuch like the spheres of the Moons, these spheres’ sole occupants are windows which look into the Planetary Heavens, described below. There are four of these: Astaffe, Sabowth, Eow, and Ildabowth. The sphere of Astaffe is actually below the sphere of the Sun.\n\n\n\nThe Spheres of the Stars\n\n\nThis sphere contains thousands of stars, which like the planets are windows, but into other Heavens of which little is known. Some of these heavens are said to be other worlds of their own, like Inannak. Scholars argue over whether there is only one sphere of the stars, or if each star is in its own sphere.\n\n\n\n\nThe Outer Sphere\n\n\nAlso called ”Beyond the Stars”, this sphere is empty and black and extends forever. But nevertheless it is said to be the origin of creatures and things that have come to Inannak in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld of Spirit\n\n\nIn the same place as the World of Mortals, but hidden from them, is the world of spirit. In this world, spirits and souls have physical manifestations, and can occasionally be seen from the mortal world. This is the world which mortal souls travel through after death, on the way to the underworld. Physical matter can not enter the world of spirit, but spirits do find it difficult to move through it. In order to reach this place, a mortal must let their own soul leave their body to enter it. This is possible through death, but there are also magical means to temporarily travel here.\n\n\nThe Underworld\n\n\nDeep in the lowest part of the world of spirit is the land of the dead, called the underworld. As the souls travel from their bodies, they make there way through the deepest tunnels of the Underneath, until they gather in large numbers around the solid rock that forms the gates. They must travel through these gates to reach the underworld itself. In the underworld, are great cities where the dead continue as they were in life, slowly forgetting that life. They are watched over by Chthonian daimons who make this place their home. The dead are not punished, but they are not allowed to leave.\n\n\n\n\nWorld of Dream\n\n\nAlso called the World of the Mind, the World of Dream is also in the same place as the World of Mortals, but hidden. Unlike the world of spirit, the boundaries are clear, you can’t see into this world while you are awake. Matter in the physical world does not affect the dream world. However, the dream world does appear as a distorted copy of the real world. Mortals usually reach this place in their dreams, where they are at the mercy of Oneirian daimons who reside there and like to play. Mortals are generally safe while dreaming, due to the contract of dreams which binds the daimons. ¡!– TODO: This may be another one of those ’curses’ –¿ There are magical means of traveling into the world which allow the mortals more control, but this breaks the contract of dreams and allows daimons to hurt mortals.\n\n\nThis world extends into the sky of the mortal world, and the spheres beyond. It is easier to travel through the dream world to reach the spheres, than it is through the physical world.\n\n\nThe Moons\n\n\nWhile the moons are barren in the physical world, in the world of dream they are full of life. The moon of Oria is a vast wilderness, home to Agrian daimons who spend their days hunting and playing music. The moon of Eilwain is where the Oneirian daimons have built their palaces and cities in a strange mimicry of human society.\n\n\n\nThe Planetary Heavens\n\n\nIn the physical world, the planets are merely windows, but in the world of dream they are portals to the Planetary Heavens. When a dream traveler comes through these portals, they gain a physical manifestation in the other world. Each of the four heavens is a vast and fantastic world. These heavens are home to the Ouranian daimons.\n\n\n\nThe Stellar Heavens\n\n\nAs with the planets, the windows among the sphere of stars are portals in the world of dream. The stellar heavens may be uncountable, and each one is a separate world. The inhabitants of these worlds are strange and unknown. Travel through the portals from the stellar heavens, in either direction, will cause the traveler to forget their past. This means none that have been through these portals are able to tell what lay beyond.\n\n\n\nBeyond the Stars\n\n\nThe outer sphere is dark and empty in the physical world, but in the dream world it is home to many strange and maddening things. Among the many weird and gigantic structures on which alien creatures and Tromian daimons make their homes is the prison where the titans and Sabowth were banished to. The Tromian daimons guard this prison. Although they allow anyone to enter, none may leave, which means none can say what lay beyond.\n\n\n\n\nTravel Between the Worlds\n\n\nThe barriers between the worlds are distinct, and the physical laws of existence within them are clear. Generally, matter from the physical world can not enter the worlds of spirit or dream. This means that mortals can not physically travel to these places.\n\n\n\nTo travel into the world of spirit or dream, the mortal’s soul or mind must leave their body in the physical world. This means they must make preparations before they travel, to ensure that their bodies are not harmed while they are out of them.\n\n\nDream Travel\n\n\nWhile traveling in the world of dream, the mortal body sleeps. Although if the travel is done through magical means, this sleep is deeper than normal sleep, and the dreamer can not be woken up without breaking the spell. The dream traveler’s body must be protected from danger, and if the travel lasts for a long time, they may suffer from dehydration, starvation, or other problems of laying still. The dreamer themself can also be injured in the dream, which could lead to death. If the mortal body dies, the dreamer reunites with their soul and commences their journey to the underworld. When the magic causing the separation ends, the dreamer will immediately return to their body by the quickest means possible.\n\n\n\nSoul Travel\n\n\nOn the other hand, travel in the world of spirit requires the soul to leave the body. This means that the mortal’s body appears as if it is dead. It does not breathe or move. As long as the mortal is not truly dead, the body does not rot, but it can take injury. If the body takes enough injury, the mortal will die, and the soul will be separated and begin its journey to the underworld. If the soul remains out of the body for too long, a separation will occur and the mortal will eventually die. The soul can also be injured while in this state, which can cause injuries to appear on the physical body. When the magic causing the travel ends, the soul will try to return to their body via the quickest means possible.\n\n\n\nPhysical Manifestation in Other Worlds\n\n\nIf the dream traveler reaches the moons, or the portals to one of the heavens, the traveler manifests a physical body in that world. This body works the same as the original mortal body in all, including the requirement for sleep (which can lead to recursive dream travel). Damage to this body, however, will not cause damage to the original body, and if this body is killed the mortal will return to the world of dream. This physical manifestation does not occur in the underworld.\n\n\n\nNon-mortal Travelers\n\n\nThe rules above apply to mortals, as well as most creatures native to the world of mortals. Some creatures, such as daimons, can travel between the worlds at will. This is done by transforming their physical bodies completely into spirit in the other world. These creatures do not need to worry about leaving a physical body behind, and if they travel into the heavens they do not need to manifest a physical body. Magic that might allow a mortal traveler to do the same is unknown. It should also be mentioned that elementals, who are beings of pure physical matter, can not travel to the worlds of dream or spirit in any way.\n\n\n\nPortals\n\n\nHere and there on Inannak, and above and below, there are portals to the moons and heavens. These portals allow direct physical travel to these other worlds, without crossing through the world of dream. By traveling this way, mortals are physically traveling into these worlds. They do not leave their body behind, and they do not manifest a new body in the other world.\n\n\n\nReconciling with Your Game System\nThe rules above may differ from the rules used for traveling to equivalent places in your game system. It will cause changes to the workings of spells and special abilities that will need to be relayed to your players. Game masters are welcome to ignore these rules and use the rules in their game system instead. However, these rules more closely mirror the dangers and drama of such travel in fantasy literature. \n\n\n\n\n\n","url":"ch_cosmology.html"},{"title":"2: People‣ Part I: The World ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nChapter 2: People\n\n\nThe inhabitants of Inannak are diverse. No scholar has records of every self-aware species that lives on land or sea, let alone the rest of the universe. This chapter is a brief summary of the major peoples that may be found in the universe around Inannak. Others may be found as well, isolated on remote islands, hidden in deep caverns, or even somewhere out in the world of dream or spirit.\n\n\nThe peoples of Inannak can be divided into two groups: Immortals and Mortals. Although those terms are imprecise.\n\n\n\nImmortals\n\n\n\n\nMortals\n\n\n\n","url":"ch_people.html"},{"title":"Immortals‣ Chapter 2: People ‣ Part I: The World ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nImmortals\n\n\nAlthough the term immortal is used for these people, many of them are merely long-lived. Immortal peoples are known for their magical nature, which provides powers that most mortals can not achieve.\n\n\nDeities\n\n\nSome immortals – and occasionally a mortal – gain so much power that they can do whatever they wish. Mortals fear these creatures. Sometimes, the mortals worship them in hopes that the immortal will protect them, or at least spare them from its anger. Sometimes, these immortals force mortals to become their servants. When a large enough group of mortals worships such a creature, that creature gains even more power, and is called a deity. However, worship itself is not enough to give them the power they need.\n\n\nMost deities are lesser deities, who enjoy the worship of small groups of people, sometimes given unwittingly through superstition and ancient tradition. Greater deities enjoy the worship of entire nations.\n\n\nSince the Mortal War and the destruction of the hebdomad, there are no longer any greater deities on the land, sea or underneath of Inannak. Even most of the lesser deities have been destroyed.\n\n\n\nThe Hebdomad\n\n\nThe hebdomad were a group of seven powerful deities that ruled over most of Inannak for thousands of years. They were daimons of ouranian, chthonian, tromian and agrian descent. They were defeated by mortals in the Mortal War several centuries ago. Most were killed, along with lesser deities that aligned with them. The rest were banished beyond the stars.\n\n\n\nThe Titans\n\n\nTitans were a specific group of deities that ruled for eons on Inannak before the God War. They were daimons of tromian descent. While most were killed or banished beyond the stars, a few were allowed to remain. Of these, some have even survived the mortal war. They likely hide from mortals if they are gathering their power to retake their place after the defeat of the hebdomad.\n\n\n\nDaimons\n\n\nA daimon is an immortal creature which can move between the physical world and non-physical worlds without leaving their bodies. Sometimes these people will be referred to as spirits, but that word implies that they only exist in the world of spirit. There are at least five peoples that can be called daimons, but each is believed to have different origins, and they may not have originally been related.\n\n\nOuranian\n\n\nOuranians originated from the four planetary heavens, which one is unknown. Their name is not related to the name of the moon Oria, but to an ancient mortal word for ”sky”. Ouranians are usually humanoid, but whatever their natural form they are larger and more beautiful than the average. They often have glowing auras around them, or light mists raising where they step. Feathered wings are not uncommon. Note that an ouranian’s beauty is not an indicator of their altruism or goodwill towards mortals.\n\n\n\nChthonian\n\n\nChthonians originated in the underworld. Most are only vaguely humanoid, although there are some who are more or less so. They have scaly or leathery skin, horns, tails, and occasionally bat-like wings. Flames and smoke often surround them. The chthonians are the only daimons that originated in the world of spirit, as the other daimon’s origins are reached via the world of dream.\n\n\n\nAgrian\n\n\nAgrians originated on the moon of Oria, but also enjoy the wild places on land and sea. They resemble the natural things of the physical world, taking on the appearance of plants and beasts. Often they are humanoid, almost mortal in appearance, but with parts from other creatures such as antlers or hooves.\n\n\n\nOneirian\n\n\nOneirians originated on the moon of Eilwain. They are usually humanoid, with thin limbs, delicate features and pale skin. They often have insect-like wings. Their form can vary greatly, and many can take on multiple forms. The oneirians follow a rather odd but strict set of traditions and rules, which makes their behavior difficult to predict.\n\n\n\nTromian\n\n\nTromians originated from beyond the stars. Their forms are chaotic, rarely humanoid, often asymmetrical. They are known for their mind magic.\n\n\n\nMixed Lineage\n\n\nDaimons beget young daimons with magic. They can use this same magic to beget children with many other peoples, from other daimons to most mortals, despite being otherwise incompatible. Daimons of mixed heritage do not blend traits the way mortals do. Instead, their children either gain parts of each parent, or an ability to transform between the two natures.\n\n\n\n\nDragons\n\n\nDragons are huge creatures with wings and long serpentine bodies, with coats of fur, scales and feathers in vivid colors. They are known for their deadly breath weapons and innate mastery of magic. Many have the ability to take the form of mortals. Dragons generally live in isolated places, preferring to be left alone to their treasures. Dragons are not truly immortal, they are bound by the laws of death, but they do live several millennia.\n\n\nIt was believed by some that dragons were once immortal, more numerous. There may have been dragon deities among early mortals. But those powerful dragons were massacred by the titans in the Dragon War, and the dragons of today are much weaker than the ones of old. Since that time, most dragons have chosen to avoid mortals, lest they risk another war that would destroy their people. Now that the hebdomad are out of power, some dragons have begun to secretly accept the worship of mortals in return for protection. Some of these may have ambitions of restoring their legendary status.\n\n\nThe number of dragons in the world is quite small, there are only 2,000 left, and only about 800 are land-based. This does not include smaller dragon kin like drakes, dragonnels, wyverns, and pseudodragons. It is rare for dragon young to survive to adulthood, and dragons only lay their eggs once a century. However, dragons who can take mortal form have also been known to beget children by mortals. Their descendants remain mortal with some dragon-like traits.\n\n\nAmong the legends it is said that dragons once came in up to fifteen different types, each with a different color and breath weapon. However, today each dragon is a unique combination of appearance and powers. Dragons can have scales, hair, feathers, lightly furred or even smooth skin, sometimes more than one covering in different parts of the body. Their coloring is vivid, often with a metallic sheen or a translucent crystalline appearance. Patterns of different colors or material are common.\n\n\nAlmost all dragons are amphibious, and as mentioned, the majority of dragons dwell underwater. These dragons tend to come in darker colors than their land-dwelling kin, and sleeker skin. They also vary much more in appearance. Some have shells like turtles, or fins and webbed limbs. Except for fire, breath weapons among the sea dwelling dragons vary just as much as their land-dwelling kin, including liquid versions of gas-based weapons.\n\n\n\nSagani\n\n\nSagani, also known as Elementals, are living beings associated with pure elements that make up the physical world. They are physical beings, whose bodies are formed mostly of one or a few elements, and are only found on the physical world of Inannak. For example, there are elementals made of fire, stone, air and water. Elementals are not limited to those four classical elements, they can be associated with other forms of energy and matter as well.\n\n\nIt is a common misconception that sagani can disappear into the otherworlds at will. This comes from their ability to meld themselves and disappear into large amounts of their elements or similar elements. They can travel easily and undetected through these substances and possibly teleport short distances to other pockets of the same substance.\n\n\nSagani are as diverse as natural beasts, and just as varying levels of sapience and sentience. Many sapient sagani have innate magical abilities, some of such power that they could compete with deities. Such creatures are known as sagani nobles, although a word from an ancient mortal language refers to them as Genies. Sagani rarely interact with other creatures, preferring to live far away from them among their own kind. On occasion, a sagani of more independent tendencies may be intrigued by mortal society. More commonly, another creature may use magic to bind the sagani to harness their abilities. This last has caused much conflict between the sagani and other peoples.\n\n\n\nUndead\n\n\nThe term undead is a broad category which can apply to four different types of creatures. The only thing they have in common is an association with and transgression of the laws of death – the natural laws which cause a mortal’s soul to leave their body upon death and travel to the underworld. This relationship creates a unique force surrounding these creatures, sometimes called the shadow of undeath, which can be used to identify them and on occasion, repel them.\n\n\nThe undead can be grouped into four types:\n\n\nAnimated Undead\n\n\nAnimated undead are corpses and other bodily remains that have been magically animated. These creatures have been given a semblance of life, usually in order to fulfill some specific task for their creator. The shadow of undeath for these undead comes from the parts of the magic required to unnaturally deter natural decomposition. Rarely are animated undead sapient, but this is not impossible.\n\n\n\nGhoul\n\n\nGhouls are creatures that feed upon corpses and the souls of the living and dead. They are not undead themselves but living creatures. However, the shadow of undeath surrounds them due to the energy of the souls they feed on.\n\n\n\nPhantom\n\n\nPhantoms are souls that have been unnaturally prevented from continuing to the underworld. Sometimes, this may be caused by the will of the soul itself, with some minor magical aid to do so. Other times they are stuck without intention. Phantoms do not have physical bodies, and live entirely in the world of spirit, but some have learned how to interact with the physical world, or even make themselves visible. This can be done because of the way physical matter interacts with the world of spirit. A soul which has not yet reached the underworld can also be considered a phantom undead, as can all the souls in the underworld.\n\n\n\n\nDenier of Death\n\n\nOn occasion, mortals will attempt to find some way to avoid death and continue to live beyond their demise. This is impossible. However, there are daimons, usually chthonian or tromian, who enjoy deceiving such mortals into believing this is possible.\n\n\nThe daimon will convince them to take some other action, which appears to be powerful magic to keep them alive, such as extracting their life force into a vessel, or accepting the bite of a blood-draining creature. But the real result of this action is to capture their soul, preventing its journey to the underworld.\n\n\nThe daimon will then take over the body, gaining access to their memories and personality, as well as powers and status which the daimon doesn’t normally have. The trapping of the soul slows down composition, giving them a new home for a long time.\n\n\n\n\nFormer Mortals\n\n\nOf all the immortal peoples of Inannak, the rarest are those who were once mortal. These unique individuals have gained or been given immortality, either through magic or the work of another immortal. Most of these immortals are wizards or sorcerers, but there are some who have little magic skill of their own. Former mortals could become deities with enough power and skill, but most learn that it is far easier to live semi-anonymously among the other mortals.\n\n\n\n","url":"sec_immortals.html"},{"title":"Mortals‣ Chapter 2: People ‣ Part I: The World ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nMortals\n\n\nThe majority of sapient peoples on Inannak are bound by the laws of death, an ancient law written into the fabric of the universe. These people are called mortals. The law of death requires a living creature to age and eventually die, so that their soul travels to the underworld. Plants and beasts of Inannak are also bound by the law of death, but the term mortal usually refers to sapient peoples. This section describes most of the well-known mortal peoples of Inannak.\n\n\nMost mortals are believed to descend from a single people, who lived on Inannak long ago. However, after eons of life under the dragons, titans and the hebdomad, they have been divided into numerous peoples.\n\n\nThe Eight Liberated Peoples\n\n\nMost of the peoples of Inannak belong to one of the eight peoples who were once subject to the hebdomad. Before the Mortal War, they knew themselves as the Vassals. Since the war and the defeat of the hebdomad, they call themselves the Liberated Peoples. Each of these groups was subject to one deity in the hebdomad, known as their patron. It is unknown whether those deities raised these groups out of earlier mortals, or took groups already existing as they were. It may be a mix of both.\n\n\nElves\n\n\nThe Äľveen, called Elves in Freetongue, are a diverse group. Their legends speak of having emerged from the underground, and some of them have returned there. They were the people of the Sabowth, the War King, who raised the High Elves as leaders of all of them. There is some evidence that the Elves have Oneirian blood in them. Sabowth had divided the Äľveen into a number of castes. The prejudices each caste has for each other remain despite the banishment of Sabowth centuries ago. The separation of the castes also gave them distinctive appearance over the millennia. Elves live in small communities, even among the most civilized, preferring to surround their villages and fortresses with natural wilderness for protection. These are the primary castes.\n\n\nCouncil Elves\n\n\n(Äľveiün) Sabowth’s personal council, a small set of less than a dozen families, ruled over all the Elves, and by their reckoning, all mortals. These are often considered part of the High Elves.\n\n\n\nHigh Elves\n\n\n(Äľvepähüülhän) The High Elves were the nobility, military officers, and wealthiest merchants. The majority of these remained loyal to Sabowth during the Mortal War. Since the Mortal War, High Elves, whether they remained loyal or not, have become pariahs. This has led to a harsh political division between them and the other Elves.\n\n\n\nWood Elves\n\n\n(Äľveshüchiin) The Wood Elves were the priests and scholars. Sabowth, in what some High Elves considered a mistake, allowed this group a sense of freedom of scholarship and thought. Thus, the philosophies of the early apostasy were well known in their circles. As they also had close contact with their lesser brethren and saw how they were treated under the hebdomad, many were quick to side with the rebellion when it began. The name ”wood elf” does not come from any affiliation with wood or forests, but a metaphor: if Elvendom were a forest, the wood elves make up the trees, while the high elves are the leaves. This metaphor ignores the gnomes, firbolgs and goblins.\n\n\n\nDeep Elves\n\n\n(Öijhärüün) Years ago, perhaps before the God War, groups of elves descended, to cavern complexes deep in the underneath. Sabowth still ruled over these elves, but allowed them their own hierarchies of authority. As groups of gnomes and goblins also joined them, they became the Äľveiün of the underground. However, during the Mortal War, most took the side of the apostasy.\n\n\n\nGnomes\n\n\n(Ngomeen) The gnomes were the craftsmen, tradesmen, and lesser merchants. Many of this caste lived and worked in underground complexes, but there were just as many who lived in the forests. Certain groups of gnomes, called Deep Gnomes, descended with the Deep Elves underground long ago, and their descendants are still occasionally seen.\n\n\n\nFirbolgs\n\n\n(Fiirböľghön) The Firbolgs were farmers and herdsmen. The firbolgs tended to live in more remote areas near their fields or herds. This meant they were often separated from the rest of the Äľveen, leading to occasional conflict.\n\n\n\nGoblins\n\n\n(Ghöbľeen) This was the lowest caste of the Äľveen, and were used as laborers and common soldiers. In Inannak, Goblins are not silly and dumb, although they might have that reputation. From this caste, Sabowth pulled out two groups for special jobs.\n\n\nHobgoblins\n\n\n(Hhöghöbľeen) were the fighting leaders, the corporals and sergeants of the Elven armies. By tradition, the lowest division of their infantry was a guard team of six soldiers. The head of this team was the hobgoblin, which literally means ”sixth goblin”.\n\n\n\nBugbears\n\n\n(Böighbärän) were the strongest of the goblins, used for brute force and heavy fighting. It’s possible that the first part of the word comes from the numbers two and three, with the sense that these goblins were ”worth” two or three of the others.\n\n\n\n\n\nGnoles\n\n\nGnoles are hairy humanoids with long snouts and sharp teeth. Their appearance varies greatly, but depending on their family and nation their faces can be reminiscent of canine or feline animals. They are carnivores, and known to be easily incited into violence and war. Before the mortal wars, this trait was encouraged by their patron Ildabowth, as well as the rest of the hebdomad. Ildabowth enjoyed sowing chaos in the ordered civilizations of the other mortals, and his siblings would often use his mortals’ services as a threat to keep the mortals in place. Ildabowth’s mastery of the underworld made it possible for the Gnoles to move from place to place unseen through caverns underground.\n\n\nAs the apostasy began to spread to the Gnoles through interaction with humans, an occult religious movement began to emerge among the Gnoles who sought to tame their fury and use it for making the world better and bringing peace. It was this cult that initiated the first successful rebellion that began the Mortal War. Since the war, the Gnole apostacists movement continues to grow. Although it is not rising without conflict – there are still many Gnoles loyal to Ildabowth, even dead – it has garnered some respect and redemption for the Gnole’s past in the eyes of other mortals.\n\n\n\nHumans\n\n\nHumans, while not as physically diverse in form as other mortal peoples, are quite diverse in culture and thought. Although raised up among the mortals by Oria, Lady of the Bow, as master hunters, she enjoyed watching them form themselves into complex and unique societies – as long as she retained final control. The freedom that she allowed them may have been a major factor leading to the apostasy. There are too many human nations to list here. \n\n\n\nOn Halflings\nHumans on Inannak are more diverse in appearance and traits than on most fantasy worlds. If your game makes use of short humanoids called halflings, or for that matter human-like creatures on any end of the size spectrum, they would be human peoples on Inannak.\n\n\n\n\nMantids\n\n\nEilwain, She Who Knows, was more careful in the design for her mortals. While others stuck with the flesh and bipedal form that mortals already had, she designed her people with more efficiency and more durability. She gave them the shape of insects, giving them extra limbs to work and fight with. She gave them hard armor plating for protection. Eilwain understood that freedom of choice and thought would lead to rebellion and dispute, so she gave them a psychic connection to each other that would make independent thought difficult.\n\n\nDuring the Mortal War, the Mantids fought for Eilwain with great loyalty, until they didn’t. The apostasy found ways to speak with the Great Queens of the Mantids and convince them of their cause, and once they were convinced so were their hive mates. Eilwain’s armies were cut by two thirds, and as the Mantids dismantled her constructs she knew her doom was imminent, and she took her own life. \n\n\n\nOrghu\n\n\nWhen Atton looked upon the mortals he chose for his own, he wanted them to stand out from the others. The Orghu are generally larger than other mortals, and many have quite unique features of appearance. They are known for their artistic traditions, ingrained into them by Atton, especially arts of performance: music, dancing and drama. Atton likes entertainment, and in addition to performances, he enjoyed watching his people fight each other in his arenas, which means Orghu culture is no stranger to violence. Atton grouped the Orghu into five peoples.\n\n\nOrcs\n\n\nThe smallest of the Orghu, orcs resemble large humans with long, up-turned snouts and green and grey skin. If a group of traveling musicians is stopping in town for a performance, it is common for most of them to be Orcs, perhaps with an Ogre for vocals.\n\n\n\nOgres\n\n\nSimilar to Orcs, but larger, and with shorter snouts. Ogres grew to their great size in the fighting arenas, but their great lungs are built for their beautiful voices – making them excel at singing and poetry.\n\n\n\nTrolls\n\n\nTall and gangly, with more humanoid faces. Trolls were built with Atton’s sense of medicine throughout, leading to their famous self-regeneration ability. Although the regeneration mostly grew out of their need to survive the fighting arenas, it also helps them learn substantial knowledge in medicine, which leads to many trolls being excellent healers and physicians.\n\n\n\nOni\n\n\nShorter trolls. Atton designed the Oni for their acting skills, and their magical entertainment.\n\n\n\nEttins\n\n\nResemble trolls with two heads. Ettins were Atton’s favorite – and their name may be related – the result of a thought that emerged one night during a drunken conversation with Eilwain, ”two heads are better than one”. Ettins were the result. Their comedy shows are famous through Inannak, and were said to be one of Atton’s favorite forms of entertainment.\n\n\n\n\nSaurians\n\n\nThe saurians were created by Eow when he grew bored with the appearance of other mortals, and was inspired by dragons. They have the same humanoid form she and her siblings had, but their skin cover ranges from feathers, to scales to amphibious skin. There are at least five peoples who owed fealty to Eow.\n\n\nTengu\n\n\nTengu are feather-covered, usually black feathers, humanoid with wing-like arms and large beaks.\n\n\n\nCrocodilians\n\n\nScaled humanoid, with long crocodilian snouts. \n\n\n\nTroglodyte\n\n\nShort, wider crocodilians who live in the underneath.\n\n\n\nBatrachians\n\n\nSmall, smooth skinned creatures, resembling frogs (but not amphibian), who prefer to live in moist environments. \n\n\n\nSalamandrian\n\n\nTall, smooth skinned creatures, vaguely like tall batrachians, except their skin is evolved to survive high heat, live near volcanoes and lava.\n\n\n\n\nSea Peoples\n\n\nThe Sea Peoples (Old Elven: Ľüfinüveen) were raised by Sabowth when he laid claim to the sea. Some call these people Sea Elves because of their shared patronage with Sabowth’s other peoples. Much like the Äľveen, the Sea People are divided into castes. However, due to the size of the places they cover, the Sea Peoples are also separated by geography. All Sea Peoples are capable of breathing in both air and water.\n\n\nTreitanns\n\n\nTreitanns are humanoid, including humanoid faces, with webbed fingers and toes, and fins on their limbs. They occupy the same ruling caste for the Sea Peoples as the High Elves for the Elves. However, their loyalty was split during the Mortal War, and many shifted closer to the apostasy in the end – it is possible that the Mortal War would not have been won if the Treitanns hadn’t taken the seas from the hebdomad.\n\n\n\nMerfolk\n\n\nThe term merfolk itself is a word from an archaic human language meaning ”sea people”. The merfolk were the commoner caste of Sea Peoples, everything from merchants, to craftsmen, to the undersea equivalent of farmers. Although still vaguely humanoid, merfolk have fish-like tails instead of legs. Unlike other Sea Peoples, the Merfolk do not travel more than a few feet out of water, as they can not walk on land.\n\n\n\nSea Goblins\n\n\nDespite their name, Sea Goblins are no relation to real Goblins, except that they took a similar position in their society as workers and soldiers. Unlike the other Sea Peoples, Sea Goblins have heads with a similar structure to fish, and some have finned tails. The Sea Goblins have divided into many nations according to what parts of the seas they live in. Some are known to live in coastal communities among other mortals. Others have descended into vast seas in caverns underground. \n\n\n\n\nShirrwern\n\n\nShirrwen are small, hairy humanoids with pointed, whiskered noses. They are reminiscent of rats, mice, but closer in appearance to large ground squirrels. Shirrwen are known for their fertility, as given them by their patron Astaffe. But they are also known for their short, but busy lives. Their own cities are made of large underground burrows, or neat wooden huts build on tree branches in forests. During the Mortal War, the Shirrwern at first fought loyally under Astaffe. But as the war progressed they began to realize how they were treated by their patron, who saw the war and her soldiers as a game. Dissent spread, the armies stopped fighting, and helped the hero Tijhändreu Mei reach their god.\n\n\n\n\nOther Mortals\n\n\nThere are other mortals on Inannak as well, although they are rare compared to the Freed Peoples. Most of these peoples hail from remote islands, hidden valleys, or deep caverns. They may be the result of years of separation from other mortals, or the experiments of lesser deities with thoughts of joining the hebdomad. Many of them occasionally travel among the Freed Peoples, where their appearance will generate curiosity. The following are just a few of them.\n\n\nDwarves\n\n\nDwarves may be related to the ancestors of the Elves, or might be created by some stone elemental deity. These stocky humanoids with skin of stone come from an isolated hive of caverns deep in the underneath. Their hive is known as the source of many valuable minerals which eventually arrive in the markets on the surface. But they only trade with their neighbors underground, so their miners are almost never seen. It is said that Ildabowth came to them long ago to claim them as his own. Their answer was to abandon their homes and move deeper underground, and build barriers and traps to keep the outsiders out. Ildabowth decided they weren’t worth it and raised the Gnoles from another mortal people of the underneath.\n\n\n\nFairies\n\n\nFairies are tiny humanoids, no more than six inches high, often with butterfly-like wings. Their origin is unclear, some suggest they are descended from Oneirians and mortals, others that these were mortals who used magic to hide from the titans, and then later the hebdomad. They are found almost all over the world, but prefer to live far from populous areas, hiding their small villages in natural settings: beneath tall grass, among tree tops, or in underground burrows. Magic is taught as part of their way of life, and they use a lot of it to hide and protect themselves from mortals and gods who would do them harm. During the Mortal War, most fairies maintained neutrality to both sides out of fear of notice by one side or the other. But individual fairies were recorded as being helpful against the hebdomad.\n\n\n\nKobolds\n\n\nThese small humanoids are descended from gnomes who rebelled against Sabowth long before the apostasy. They resemble small gnomes with a wizened appearance. The rebels were forced to hide from Sabowth in order to escape, and they found ways to hide in plain sight. In addition to caves and mines, they’ve also been known to stow away in ships, and hide in hidden places in mortal cities and villages. Kobolds were often forced to steal food to survive, but would pay for that food by completing small household tasks. As they grew bolder from their survival, they began to sabotage places and things important to Sabowth, and later the rest of the hebdomad. They became an important resource for the apostasy during the Mortal War, as they knew how to get into places and where to get information. Since the war, they’ve begun to emerge from their hiding places, forming small close-knit communities.\n\n\n\nDracobolds\n\n\nAfter the kobold rebellion, a group of the rebels found their way to an island where a dragon lived. The dragon agreed to let them live if they would plead fealty to her. Since then, these kobolds have taken on a reptilian appearance. \n\n\n\nAnemoi\n\n\nThese winged humanoids make their home on an island in the Southern Hemisphere of Inannak. \n\n\n\nSerpentfolk\n\n\nThe serpentfolk were an experiment that Eow had begun on humans, in secret from Oria. They live on a tropical island, where they worship her in her serpentine form. In return, she granted them features of snakes and special powers. They had found some sort of immortality in that worship, allowing them to be reincarnated. With each reincarnation they became more and more serpentine, with the most powerful becoming large, multi-headed snake-like creature reminiscent of Eow.\n\n\n\nBlue Gnomes\n\n\nAlthough it’s not clear if they are related to real gnomes, the blue gnomes come from an island near the northern arctic. They are similar in size to gnomes, but their skin is bluish. They are hostile to visitors, and will attempt to kill any who land on their island. Still, some have been spotted in other parts of the world, although their purposes there are unclear. \n\n\n\nPeghroads\n\n\nThought to be an early experiment of Ildabowth’s, the bog folk live in an around the dismal swamp of Peghro, where Astaffe met her end. The Peghroads are humanoid with mostly bare grey to dark green skin, spotted with red blotches, with thick green hair on their head. Their clawed hands and feet are webbed for better swimming in the swamp. Unlike other humanoids, the peghroads are nocturnal. They are carnivorous, and have been known to hunt other thinking creatures for food or mystical purposes. During Astaffe’s last days, she claimed the Peghroads as hers after many of the Shirrwen had abandoned her, and they fought loyally against those who would take her. In the councils and trials that followed the war, calls were made to destroy the Peghroads, but many Shirrwen argued against this, knowing what it was like to be under Astaffe’s control. \n\n\n\nSkulkers\n\n\nThese large humanoids are from the underneath, and were secretly raised by a lesser deity who had a dispute with the hebdomad. They are big and tall, although they walk on their knuckles. Their hair is white or pale brown, although it is common for them to decorate their fur with paints and dyes. Skulker culture is hostile to outsiders and other mortals. Their god raised them in secret as he assembled an army to stake his claim against the hebdomad. The Skulker god was destroyed by Sabowth soon after he sent the Skulkers to invade the caverns of the Deep Elves. \n\n\n\nDoppelgängers\n\n\nIn the early days of the Hebdomad, a lesser tromian deity contemplated challenging the hebdomad for rulership over a section of the world. It gathered a number of mortals under its care together and gave them the ability to take the form of almost any other mortal, and the mind powers to back up their mimicry. These doppelgängers were to be the tromian’s spies and army. However, the tromian was killed in a dispute with another lesser deity before it could continue its plans. The doppelgängers now survive by hiding amidst other mortal societies. Many continue to worship their god, waiting for it to call upon them to fulfill their task.\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed Mortal Lineages \n\n\nMost mortal peoples descend from the same ancestral mortal people, a people who are only described of in the oldest myths. A close examination shows that the boundaries that separate many peoples are not clear. Unions between people of different ancestry are not uncommon. Some of these unions result in children. Many such children are unable to have children of their own, but some continue passing physical traits of their parents onto their own descendants.\n\n\n\nImmortal Lineages\n\n\nThe same biological incompatibilities between mortals are even stronger between them and immortals. However, there are ways that the immortal peoples have been able to introduce some of their features into some mortal populations. There is no doubt that these descendants are still mortal, but their unusual lineage makes them different from the others. In all of these cases, these people have traits that blend into the traits of another mortal people.\n\n\nDragonbloods\n\n\nShape changing dragons who live among mortals often form a social attachment with those mortals, and on occasion that can lead to children. The descendants of such a union resemble mortals in most ways, but often have traits that point to their heritage – patches of scales or feathers, unusual eyes, perhaps a vestigial tail or wings. They often gain limited access to the natural magic of dragons, and on rare occasions, their breath powers.\n\n\n\nDaimonbloods\n\n\nDaimons, especially deities, have intermixed with mortals throughout the millennia, sometimes through shape changing abilities, sometimes through magical means. The mortal descendants of such a union will have traits that resemble their ancestry: Chthonian ancestry may provide horns or unusual skin, Ouranian ancestry may give them a slight glow, Oneirian ancestry an otherworldly appearance, and so forth.\n\n\n\nSaganikin\n\n\nAlthough elementals are not biologically compatible with mortals, elementals nobles may have means to grant gifts to mortals that result in inherited traits and abilities. Their descendants will have elemental powers and physical traits reminiscent of their power’s origins.\n\n\n\nChangelings\n\n\nThe Oneirians have an unusual practice of replacing mortal children at young ages with their own kind. Both individuals are called changelings. The Oneirian replacement remains an immortal daimon, but the human hostage will often gain unusual traits from their time among the daimons.\n\n\n\n\nMagical Transformations\n\n\nAs magic exists on Inannak, there are the occasional accidents and experiments of wizardry that bring about more unique creatures. Sometimes they’re a regular mortal transformed somehow, other times they are created by recipe. None of these creatures occur naturally, they are not born with these characteristics. Not that they couldn’t have been transformed at birth, however.\n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nConstructs are machines that have been given a semblance of life by some powerful magic. Most are mindless, and complete their ordered tasks without comment. However, the magics that create them sometimes draw a lesser daimon into the machine, giving it some sort of sapience. Generally, the shock of the transformation removes any memory the daimon had of its previous life. On rare occasions, constructs are made of the corpses of the dead, which essentially makes them undead.\n\n\n\nWerecreatures\n\n\nTherianthropy is a disease said to have been created by Oria as a way to improve her hunters. The disease allows its mortal victims to transform into one of a number of beasts. Once the disease fully takes hold, the transformation is involuntary, occurring during the period of the full moon of Oria. Victims also lose their abilities to reason and quickly become angry and violent. Only victims who have lived with the disease for a long time are able to develop coping mechanisms that allow them to control the transformation and their emotions. Therianthropy is not hereditary, although it can be transferred in the womb. Different strains of therianthropy cause transformations into different beasts: wolves, bears, tigers, cats and rats are most well known.\n\n\n\nMetamorphosed\n\n\nOccasionally, a mortal will be magically transformed into another shape, or an animal or plant will be transformed into a mortal.\n\n\n\n\nAlien Peoples\n\n\nThe world of Inannak is sealed off from other multiverses. However, it is a universe, and there are other worlds than the land, sea and underneath of Inannak. Occasionally, intelligent people from the stars or beyond appear on Inannak. Such mortals have no memory of their past, or at least no knowledge that will disrupt the history of the world. This may be the work of some unknown god, or a curse laid by the hebdomad. \n\n\nThere are not enough of a population of most of these alien mortals to discuss them in depth. But if there is a people that you wish to use in your own journeys through this world, and it doesn’t seem to fit with the rest, you may add it as an alien. Keep in mind the required amnesia, and the potential culture shock when interacting with other mortals. That shock which may not be as powerful as you’d think considering the diversity of life already found on Inannak.\n\n\nThere are two notable groups of alien peoples that should be mentioned.\n\n\n\nStrangers\n\n\nSometimes, people of Inannak may use the term ”stranger” with an audible capital ’S’. This term refers to a type of alien creature which is not originally native to Inannak, but which has established a small presence here. Most of these peoples come from places beyond the stars, worlds which do not have suns, and thus they prefer to live in the underneath, or in the ocean. Some of them may have Tromian ancestry. Notable Strangers of Inannak include the legendary Eye Beasts, the Horrors of the Depths, and the Thought Slicers. Some of these peoples are as long-lived and powerful as dragons, and might fit better into the immortal category.\n\n\n\nStrangelings\n\n\nStrangers can not breed with other mortals, and rarely have any reason to try. However, mortals may be changed by their experiences with them. For example: slaves of Thought Slicers and Eye Lords change over generations. Their descendants, if they gain their freedom, may develop unusual physical traits such as tentacles, or psychic abilities gained from defending their thoughts against their masters’ abuses. Strangelings might also be descendants of mortals that have been removed from the physical world and survived for several generations in other worlds.\n\n\n\n\n","url":"sec_mortals.html"},{"title":"II: History‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nPart II:\nHistory\n\n\n\n3: Origins\n\n\n\n\n4: The Hebdomad\n\n\n\n","url":"part_history.html"},{"title":"3: Origins‣ Part II: History ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nChapter 3: Origins\n\n\nThe origins of the world of Inannak are lost in time.

Before Inannak, there was nothing. Then the darkness faded, and Inannak emerged. The stars opened in the sky as they do every cloudless evening. They shone upon the seas, which receded to reveal the land. The moons and the sun that measure our time were the last to appear.\n— Revelations of the Apostacy, Book of the Creation, Chapter 1.\n\n\n\nThe Apostacy claim the Apostate God revealed this this story to their elders long ago. In their story, Inannak had no creation, it just appeared. Soon after the emergence, beasts, plants and other living things became. For a long time, creatures would emerge from hidden places ready to populate the world. As each arrived, they would speak to the stars and other things of the sky, and to those who came before them, and arrange a place for themselves in it. After one million years of this, the world became lush and full of life.\n\n\nCycle of the Dragons\n\n\nThe last creatures to emerge upon Inannak were the dragons. When they arrived, they did not ask what their place was. They instead claimed dominion over all the creatures of Inannak.\n\n\nThe dragons of this time were even more powerful and than the dragons of today, and immortal. The story says that they were like gods themselves. These were the first thinking beings, apart from Innanak, to arrive. But there were no mortals yet, so their subjects were the animals and plants.\n\n\nWhile their society was not without strife, they did not wage war. Violence only erupted in individual disputes. As today, dragons preferred to live by themselves. There were no cities, but they did build steadings to protect their livestock and possessions. The oldest ruins in the world are thought to be remnants of these steadings.\n\n\nThe dragons ruled for one hundred thousand years.\n\n\n\nCycle of the Titans\n\n\nFrom among and beyond the stars came the primordial spirits. They did not interfere with the dragons’ claim of dominion, but hid in the stars and watched. Some among these beings begat children, who were immortal giants and monsters known as titans. They saw Inannak and thought it would be better to rule there than to hide in the sky.\n\n\nThe Dragon War\n\n\nThe titans made their claim on Inannak and fought the dragons who defended it for one thousand years. This became known as the Dragon War. The dragons saw the need for a great army, and created mortals to help in their fight. In the creation of mortals, the dragons touched mortality. Since that time, dragons are no longer immortal. Although they may live for thousands of years, they will still die, and must still have children.\n\n\nBut the masterwork of the dragons, the mortals, were their undoing. The titans knew how to control the mortals, and took them for their own armies. These armies of titans and mortals destroyed the original dragons, leaving only a few young offspring to survive in remote places.\n\n\n\nThe First Mortals\n\n\nIn a contradiction of the previous story, the Revelations describe the creation of the mortals in separate verses of this cycle. The titan Ithax, when he first arrived in Inannak, created a family of ten mortals out of ten boulders he found. They were rough models and they struggled to understand who and what they were and how to survive. In disgust, Ithax turned from them, leaving them to fend for themselves. But three dragons found them and taught them how to thrive in Inannak. It was these people that the dragons nurtured into their army.\n\n\nThese first mortals were known as the elder people. Although they had two legs, two arms and a face, they were not the same as any peoples on Inannak today.\n\n\n\nRule of the Titans\n\n\nWith the defeat of the dragons, the titans began their cruel rule over the creatures of Inannak. They used the mortals as both slaves and cattle. The mortals lived in fear, but had no choice but to obey them. The titans created monsters to keep the mortals in their place, and these became their new army. It is said that when a mortal has a strange nightmare, it is a memory of this time.\n\n\nThe cycle of the titans lasted fifty thousand years.\n\n\n\n\nCycle of the Hebdomad\n\n\nIn the last millennia of the cycle of titans, a horrible prophecy was given to the titan Ithax. It was said that seven children would be born to him who would destroy the titans. Ithax sought out all his children and had each one put to death. But one among the children escaped before her execution, and rescued the other six. There followed a repeated series of escapes and recaptures. He finally attempted to kill them himself, but was tricked into killing seven deer instead. Still, he believed them dead.\n\n\nWhile they hid, the hebdomad took the shape of mortals and lived among them. They watched their parents’ power and the plight of the mortals, and agreed that something should be done. Secretly, they gathered others among their generation into an army to overthrow their elders.\n\n\nThe God War\n\n\nThe god war lasted a thousand years, and devastated the world. When the Hebdomad defeated the titans, they banished Ithax and the most powerful of the foes back beyond the stars. The rest who survived were forced into servitude or imprisoned in remote places. \n\n\n\nRule of the Hebdomad\n\n\nThus began the age of the hebdomad, which is also the beginning of mortal civilization. Each of the seven gathered their favorites from among the mortals and gave them power over the other mortals. These became the first kings and emperors, and a false hope spread among the mortals that their time of fear was over. But the hebdomad instead took the place of their parents, keeping the world under their tight control. Mortals remained blinded to their captivity, as a singing bird in a cage, or an exotic beast in a menagerie. The time of the hebdomad would last ten thousand years until their destruction during the Mortal War.\n\n\n\n\n","url":"sec_inannak-creation.html"},{"title":"The Four Eggs‣ Chapter 3: Origins ‣ Part II: History ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nThe Four Eggs\n\n\n\nBefore the beginning four great eggs lay amidst the void. When these eggs hatched, they burst into showers of fire and ice which filled the void, and four great dragons emerged. These dragons were Chaamat, Behiimat, Siisat, and another which has no name. But when the dragons met each other, they fought. The three tore the fourth one apart, scattering it’s body into the void.\nWhen the others saw what they had done, they mourned. Siisat flew into the sky, too angry at their siblings to face them. Behiimat dismembered the body and they and Chaamat used it and the shells of their eggs to create the world. When they were finished, Chaamat descended into the depths to mourn their shame, and Behiimat flew to the most remote land they could find. The blood of their sibling dripped from their claws, fertilizing the ground. And from that blood grew all the living things of the world: plant, beast, mortal, and lesser dragon.\n— The Tale of the Four Eggs\n\n\n\nThis story is told by many Elven and Goblin peoples, although the details vary from telling to telling. The passage above comes from one of the more popular transcriptions of the tale. Other versions add details about the nature of the void and the eggs, or the reason for the fight between the dragons. Many versions change the nature of the conflict. One has Chaamat alone kill the fourth, as well as Siisat. Another has the fourth one be the instigator of the violence. In another, the fourth dragon is stillborn and there is no conflict.\n\n\nThe First Mortals\n\n\nThe first mortals are always the same caste as the people who are telling the story, whether they are elves, gnomes, firbolg or goblins. They were formed in a deep cavern, their creation hidden from both Chaamat and Behiimat. But they found their world dark and barren, so they chose to search for a new home. In their search they saw spiders crawling into a tiny hole. They grabbed hold of the spiders’ tiny legs and the spiders pulled them through the hole into the bright land under the sky. Here they found all manner of food and beautiful things, and most decided to stay. Some chose instead to bring the great things they found back into the caves.\n\n\nThe stories do not agree on whether non-elf peoples descended from these mortals. Some give long origin stories for peoples like the humans or the saurians, descended from these first mortals as well. Others say that those peoples were created in other places, but always after the first mortals emerged from the underworld.\n\n\n\nThe Gods\n\n\nThe children of Chaamat, Behiimat and Siisat mated with the lesser dragons, with mortals, and with celestials from beyond the void. Their children conquered the living creatures of Inannak and placed the mortals under their rule. They forced all creatures to serve them, punishing without justice those who failed. From among these gods, seven eventually rose to power over all Inannak. They sought out Chaamat and Behiimat and slew them to ensure their constant rule. They could not reach Siisat, who had flown beyond the stars.\n\n\nFrom amidst the mortals they found a few who pleased them more than any other, and adopted them as their seconds. Thus arose the first high elves, and later the nobles of the other peoples. These great ones ruled over their people, enjoying the wealth and power the gods had granted them. In return they delivered punishments and rewards to the people as required by the gods to maintain order.\n\n\n\n","url":"sec_four-eggs.html"},{"title":"The Sacred Tablets of Ithax‣ Chapter 3: Origins ‣ Part II: History ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nThe Sacred Tablets of Ithax\n\n\n\nIthax created himself, and then the world. He looked out upon it and saw emptiness. He said that it would be good to fill this empty world. And so, he raised up the sky above it, and placed in it the sun, the moons and the stars. He let out a puff of air and the winds began to blow. He brought forth water and the seas filled.\nHe liked what he had created, but there was much yet to do, and he was lonely. And so he created lesser gods to help him in his tasks. Above these gods he set his eight chosen to continue the creation.\n— The Book of Creation, Sacred Tablets of Ithax\n\n\n\nThe original sacred tablets were destroyed along with the Temple of the Hebdomad. Copies of the text circulate in hidden places and are secretly read to those who still follow the hebdomad. Some copies have been obtained by libraries and are maintained for scholarly research.\n\n\nThe group of eight chosen lesser gods were called the octad. They helped him raise mountains, carve rivers and lakes, and much other detailed work. And Ithax was content with what they had done.\n\n\nBut one of the eight, who is only referred to as the eighth, grew tired of the work. They asked Ithax to create more helpers for them. For unclear reasons, Ithax found the request impertinent and grew angry. Nevertheless, he agreed and created creatures in the form of the gods, only mortal. After this final act, he left the world to watch the octad complete the creation from afar.\n\n\nAfter Ithax left, the octad continued the creation as instructed. They brought forth trees, shrubs and grass on the land. They filled the seas and lakes with fish and the land and sky with beasts and birds. The mortals that Ithax created helped the eight with their work. When the creation was complete, the eight chose to rest for a time. Seven among the eight left the mortals to travel the world.\n\n\nThe mortals lived happily among the beasts in the forests. They were innocent then, and knew nothing of evil. When they were hungry or thirsty, they ate of the food given by the eight. When they were cold or tired, they hid in shelters the eight had made for them. But while the seven were elsewhere, the eighth moved among the mortals, and taught them evil. He taught them how to kill, how to steal what was not theirs, and how to live without honor to the gods.\n\n\nWhen the other gods returned and saw this, they were frightened and asked Ithax what they should do. Ithax saw what had happened and became angry. He banished the eighth. The seven gods left were called the hebdomad.\n\n\nThen he turned to the mortals and punished them. Because they had learned evil, they would now need to hunt for their food or grow it themselves. They would need to build their own shelters. And they would need to live in fear of each other, lest another mortal kill them or steal from them.\n\n\nIthax turned to the hebdomad and berated them for letting the eighth teach such evil. He gave them the job to watch over the mortals, and prevent evil from spreading further. He divided the mortals among them. The hebdomad would be his voice among the mortals, and teach them the right things to do. They were allowed to punish those mortals who disobeyed them and continued to follow evil.\n\n\nThe story continues on with myths of the first days of civilization, some of which coincide with known history.\n\n\n","url":"sec_sacred-tables-ithax.html"},{"title":"4: The Hebdomad‣ Part II: History ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nChapter 4: The Hebdomad\n\n\nWhatever their true origins are, the hebdomad ruled over Inannak from the dawn of time to about three hundred years ago. The hebdomad is an ancient word that means ”group of seven”, as that was their number. They ruled among the mortals, claiming to be the voice and hands of someone greater. The Ithaxians called this greater god Ithax, but there is no historical record outside their scriptures which names this greater god.\n\n\nThe hebdomad were never the only gods. There were many lesser gods who obeyed them. According to some myths a few greater, but they do not interfere with the world. There are also gods unassociated with them, such as the dragon gods, who nevertheless left the hebdomad alone to rule mortals.\n\n\nEach of the hebdomad claimed some domain as a focus of their power. These domains merely describe their patronage, powers and preferred methods of rule, not their job. They were not in charge of maintaining those domains. Nor did they expect their chosen mortals to focus on these same domains. While some domains were positive, many domains also came with their opposites, hate for love, disease for medicine, etc. The gods were masters of those as well.\n\n\nEach of the hebdomad were also associated with an astronomical body. Many of their names are the same as the names of those bodies in some languages. But the hebdomad did not live in these places in the skies, but in palaces among mortals.\n\n\nThe descriptions of the power and appearance of the gods below come from traditional sources. Many of these sources have good reason to exaggerate, whether the bias was towards them or the heroes who slew them. The hebdomad may have been closer to mortals in their power than is evident from this knowledge.\n\n\nYes, this is almost all from Wikipedia research, which is acceptable since this is fantasy and I’m just making up names.\n\n\nOnce I’d found the names, I gave them the old Anglicization routine, which allows me to change the spelling while still retaining some semblance of the pronunciation.\n\n\nThe personalities are borrowed from the Greek Gods, partly by relating them to Solar planets and then getting their associated gods. However, I had to play around with these, since I wanted equal female and male, and some important gods (Hades, Hekate and Poseidon) weren’t represented. –¿\n\n\nOria\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nHunting, weaponry, nature, animals and plants.\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe greater moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOria was said to be the favored elder sister of Atton, calling herself Lady of the Bow. In deific form, she had a human body with a wolf’s head and falcon’s wings. In mortal form she was known for shining silver skin and hair. Her skin was said to reflect like a mirror. Any who saw her could also see themselves on her skin surrounded by a glamour that showed how she saw them. Unlike her sibling, she never smiled, and her punishments and rewards came with the same expression.\n\n\nAs a god of hunting, she was an expert at tracking. As a god of weaponry, she was an expert at any bow, sword, spear or pole-arm. She even held and gave to her armies unique weapons that she had created herself. During the Mortal War, she was said to have created weapons that could shoot around corners and fly miles away and still hit their target. She was killed by a weapon of her own invention, that she had created to kill the one known as the Apostate God.\n\n\nOria was the patron of the human peoples.\n\n\n\n\nEilwain\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nKnowledge, craft, art, magic.\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe lesser moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEilwain was called ”She Who Knows”. Her deific form was never recorded, she was said to wear long robes with deep cowls. Her sleeves were said to appear empty even as she held things in unseen hands. In her mortal form she was an elderly woman who wore a black cloth over her eyes, although she was not known to be blind.\n\n\nAs god of knowledge, Eilwain was said to know any idea a mortal could have before it was even spoken or written. She is said to have invented writing to record this knowledge. Many fabled tomes are attributed to her own writing. Often these tomes are known as hiding deeper knowledge hidden by code or puzzles, or containing a curse on mortals who read them.\n\n\nAs god of craft and magic, she was known for creating devices both miraculous and infernal, which no mortal could ever discern the true workings of. With little thought, she could find weak points and disable any complex device, or shatter some structure. She created an army of constructs to serve and protect her during the Mortal War. Eilwain destroyed herself when she was put in a situation where the only possible outcome she could find was her own death.\n\n\nEilwain was the patron of the Mantids.\n\n\n\n\nAstaffe\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nLove, desire, greed, lust, fertility.\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe first planet, ”the blue one”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstaffe was called the Gentle One, although ironically, and the Formless One. They were not recorded as woman or man, but would appear in a different form every time they were seen. Nor were they known to have a separate deific and mortal form.\n\n\nAs a god of love and desire, Astaffe could convince any mortal to do her bidding with kind words and acts. They could create connections among mortals to fit their needs. They could turn enemies into friends and friends into enemies.\n\n\nAs god of fertility, Astaffe could cause fields and forests to grow or turn barren. In the Mortal War they blocked the paths of the apostates with thick forests full of multitudes of insects and other pests. One such forest was grown in the dismal swamp of Peghro, where she hid in her last days. Astaffe was killed by the mortal hero half-elf, Tijhändreu Mei, who struggled for days through the tangled brush to find the god. \n\n\nAstaffe was the patron of the Shirrwern peoples.\n\n\n\n\nAtton\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nMedicine, life, divination, music, poetry.\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe sun, although no language connects his name with that. Some scholars believe this association is merely due to process of elimination and his associated color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtton called himself Lord of Music and Medicine. In his deific form, he was a figure of burning flame. In mortal form he was known for his beautiful golden skin and blonde hair. It was said that subjects who saw him became so struck by that beauty that they could not disobey their commands. Atton was known to maintain his smile and humor even as he meted out horrible pain to his dissenters. None could know if they had gained Atton’s approval or disapproval until the moment the punishment came. Sometimes those punishments appeared to be rewards at first, only showing his malevolence as the recipient began to reap the painful consequences.\n\n\nAs a god of music and poetry, Atton would give concerts and recitals outside his golden palace to all who would attend. Often, special invitations were given to honored guests. Those who attended these concerts would hear his beautiful words and their bonds to Atton would be strengthened. Few could leave these concerts without feeling a profound sense of honor at having witnessed it.\n\n\nAs god of medicine and life, Alton had a deep understanding of the body. He was known to be expert at healing any disease and fixing any wound. With the flick of the hand, Atton could heal the patients in an entire hospital, or destroy the vital organs of an army. In the Mortal War, Atton used their powers to raise armies of dead to destroy the Apostasy. He was destroyed by being tricked into submersing himself in the lava pits of Mount Inferno.\n\n\nAtton was the patron of the Orghu peoples.\n\n\n\n\nSabowth\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nWar, struggle, destruction, travel, water\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe second planet, ”the red one”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSabowth was called the War King. His mortal and deific forms were the same. He appeared as a prepubescent boy with horns. In some legends, his behavior mimicked that of a spoiled child. But this was not the story formula of the spoiled child getting punished, Sabowth usually got his way. Sabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Ildabowth.\n\n\nAs god of war, Sabowth was a master tactician and strategist. When he set to the field, he rarely lost a battle except due to interference from other gods. He could pick out the enemies weaknesses and exploit them with precision. His greatest strength was his knowledge of the ways and his ability to move armies and their support along the fastest routes. This allowed his domain to overlap with travel, where he was often known as the Wanderer.\n\n\nAfter the God War, as the others in the hebdomad divided the world into parts, Sabowth saw the oceans and fresh waters remained unclaimed. Seeing how much there was out there, he made his own claim to them. Thus, he also claims power over the ocean winds, currents and waves, as well as the depths below and what lives there. He was master of navies as well as armies. He was lord of the monsters which thrive in the sea, and used these creatures to aid his navy in the Mortal War.\n\n\nSabowth could not be killed through strategy. Nor could he be killed by numbers, as he always had a fallback plan. While some tried these steps, they did not succeed. Instead, Sabowth was captured and chained by his own soldiers, who had grown tired of the war and joined the apostasy in secret. He was then banished beyond the stars by seventeen mortal wizards and a dragon.\n\n\nSabowth was patron of the Äľveen and the Sea Peoples.\n\n\n\n\nEow\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nSky, weather\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe third planet, ”the white one”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEow itself is a word for the sky in one human tongue, it is apparent that Eow’s real name is not spoken. In her deific form, she had a humanoid body with stork legs and seven snake heads. In mortal form, she was a powerful middle-aged woman with thick, dark hair. She was known for the great staff she carried, with which she was said to create lightning and call storms.\n\n\nAs god of the sky and weather, Eow possibly had more power than any of the other gods. She could call rains, wind, lightning and other forces of nature, as well as clear out the clouds and calm the winds. She could bring rain or drought to farmers, and foul or fair travel to sailors. When she went to the field during the Mortal War, one could guarantee that the weather would be bad.\n\n\nWhile Eow did not claim any godly domain of politics, leadership or law, she was a master at all. She manipulated the politics of the mortal world throughout the age of the hebdomad, and played royalty and nobles like pawns in a game. She was called by the other gods in cases where they need arbitration. Eow was also the chief of the council of the hebdomad. This did not mean she was the leader of the hebdomad, but that she kept order in their meetings and discussions and often had the final say in decisions.\n\n\nNone know how Eow was killed. Her death was discovered by servants one morning in her palace while her armies were on the march to battle. The room she lay in had been sealed shut to the outside and her guards remained undisturbed by all doors and shutters. Although she had been stabbed, there was no sign of the weapons used to do so.\n\n\nEow was the patron of Saurian peoples.\n\n\n\n\nIldabowth\n\n\nDomains\n\n\nAgriculture, death, underworld, minerals, wealth\n\n\n\nAstronomy\n\n\nThe fourth planet, ”the yellow one”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIldabowth was called Emperor of the Underworld, and this term referred both to the world after death and the world below the ground. In his deific form, he had a humanoid body with the head of a bull and arms ending in scythe blades. In his mortal form, he was an elder man with a thick beard and hair, and fine, noble clothes. Ildabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Sabowth.\n\n\nMuch like his brother Sabowth, Ildabowth saw unclaimed opportunity when the rest of the hebdomad divided the world among them. Ildabowth laid claim to all things underground, and everything that underground symbolized, even death. Through this claim he also claimed the minerals taken from the ground, the crops that rose from them, and the labor required to retrieve this wealth. He ran his dominions as a foreman would run a factory or a merchant would run his trade.\n\n\nIldabowth was the first to fall in the Mortal War, early on. He was killed after the apostasy began to spread among his people. Their rise in rebellion initiated the Mortal War, and their execution of Ildabowth convinced the other mortals that the war could be successful.\n\n\nIldabowth was the patron of the Gnoles.\n\n\n\n\nThe Apostate God\n\n\nWhile likely not a part of the hebdomad, the apostate god was the anonymous deity who initiated the apostasy and led to the end of the hebdomad. This deity was said to have revealed truth to the first apostates, and lent inspiration and weapons to the rebels during the mortal war. The apostasy grew in secrecy, and obfuscated much of their knowledge and activities to avoid detection and protect each other. Most of the interactions with the apostate god were not recorded. The only recordings known are the story of the deity’s revelations to the first apostacists, and four interactions corroborated by different biased sources during the Mortal War. The last such interaction records the death of the apostate god in battle with the hebdomad.\n\n\nThere could be many untold beings in the universe who could hold the mantle of the apostate god. Or perhaps the being was made up by the apostasy to support their beliefs and cause. The truth may never be known. However, there are at least three popular theories of the Apostate God’s identity.\n\n\nMembers of the Hebdomad\n\n\nIn this theory, the hebdomad themselves unwittingly supported the apostasy. The consensus for this theory attributes it to two of them: Eilwain and Oria. The revelations of the apostasy were found hidden in tomes that Eilwain had written, and this knowledge was spread slowly throughout. When the rebellions began, the apostasy initiated a small counter-rebellion who believed they were fighting for the hebdomad. This counter-rebellion was sent to Oria for aid, and she provided them weapons. When they asked for a weapon that would help them hunt and kill the apostate god, a being Oria herself had been frustrated in hunting, she gave them such a powerful weapon. This was then delivered into the hands of the apostasy, and used in as many as three of the deaths of the hebdomad.\n\n\n\nA Child of the Hebdomad\n\n\nA popular legend tells the tale of a child who was born to, or raised by, one of the hebdomad and a mortal. The identity of the parent differs in various tellings. In this legend, the child grew up jealous of their parent. At first, they sought to follow the same path as their parents (as told by the apostasy), gathering fellow gods to fight their parents and take over with a new generation. But they then saw a scene of horrible mortal suffering, perhaps the spread of a disease, or the execution of a village. This scene convinced them that there could not be a new generation of gods, and that the mortals had to take the world from the gods themselves. From their this god began to gather and teach mortals, the first apostates, and reveal the truth as they knew it.\n\n\n\nThe Eighth\n\n\nThe followers of the Temple of Ithax, whom they know as father of the hebdomad, spoke of an eighth child who was banished by Ithax before he moved beyond the stars. It is their belief that the apostate god was the one known as the eighth, who had somehow contacted the first apostates and led them onto the wrong path. The historian Jildas of Leth suggests that although this idea is tainted by the Ithaxian beliefs, there may indeed have been another god of similar power to the hebdomad. Such a god could have been banished by the hebdomad, and would then have a vengeful motive to provide aid to the mortals. \n\n\n\n\n","url":"ch_hebdomad.html"},{"title":"III: Languages‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nPart III:\nLanguages\n\n\n\n5: Old Elven\n\n\n\n","url":"part_languages.html"},{"title":"5: Old Elven‣ Part III: Languages ‣ The World of Inannak","content":"\n\nChapter 5: Old Elven\n\n\nOld Elven (Äľveen /ælʲβʲe̞ːnʲ/) is a classical language originally spoken in the ancient Elven Dominion, and is used as a literary, scriptural or legal language in some lands. It is the proto-language for numerous modern Elven and Goblin dialects. \n\n\nThe language is an aggultinative and synthetic language. Combinations of prefixes and suffixes are added to roots to form words. In Old Elven, each change in category such as gender, person, number, or tense is handled by a different affix, whereas in an inflective language, which the reader may be more famliar with, a single affix might be used to indicate a single combination of all of those.\n\n\nWord order in Old Elven is generally subject-object-verb, and adjectives come after nouns. The language recognizes makes use of four genders: female, male, animate neutral and inanimate neutral.\n\n\n\nNOTE\nOld Elven is described here for use in building single words such as proper nouns for personal use. It is not intended to be a spoken or literary language, and thus the grammar is not described.\n\n\n\nPhonology\n\n\nStress is always on the second to last syllable of the word.\n\n\nConsonants\n\n\nIn addition to typical classifications, Old Elven has a broad and slender contrast to most consonants. A broad consonant is generally velarized and labialized if the consonant isn’t already labial, before a front vowel. Velarized means that the back of the tongue is raised during pronunciation. This results in a slight ’w’ sound as the consonant ends. Similarly, a slender consonant is generally palatialized before a back vowel, resulting in a slight ’y’ sound. \n\n\nIn the below chart, when two consonants appear, the first is broad and the second slender.\n\n\nOld Elven Consonants\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonants\nLabial\nCoronal\nDorsal\nGlottal\n\n\nPlosive - voiceless\npˠ pʲ\nt̪ˠ\nk c\n\n\n\nPlosive - voiced\nbˠ bʲ\nd̪ˠ\nɡ ɟ\n\n\n\nFricative - voiceless\nɸˠ ɸʲ\nsˠ ʃ\nx ç\nh\n\n\nFricative - voiced\nβˠ βʲ\n\nɣ\n\n\n\nAffricate - voiceless\n\n— tɕ\n\n\n\n\nAffricate - voiced\n\n— dʑ\n\n\n\n\nApproximant - voiced\n\n\n— j\n\n\n\nNasal\nmˠ mʲ\nn̪ˠ nʲ\nŋ ɲ\n\n\n\nTrill\n\nrˠ rʲ\n\n\n\n\nLateral fricative\n\nɫ̪\n\n\n\n\nLateral approximant\n\n— lʲ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoiceless stops are generally aspirated, unless they occur after a fricative or at the end of a word. The labial fricatives are bilabial, not labiodental. The coronal stops and the broad nasal are dental, not alveolar.\n\n\nThe slender equivalent to the coronal stops (/t̪ˠ/ and /d̪ˠ/) are affricates (/tɕ/ and /dʑ/), just as the slender version of the voiceless coronal fricative is a palatal fricative /ʃ/. In a related shift, the dorsal voice fricative becomes the approximant /j/. However, the /j/ has an allophone of /ʝ/ (voiced /ç/) at the end of a syllable when not word-final. Using a similar pattern, the dorsal consonants are not velarized or palatalized, but the consonants shift position towards velar or palatal instead. The glottal consonant does not have a broad or slender form. The broad /l/ is a voiceless lateral fricative.\n\n\nThe trills /rˠ/ and /rʲ/ are pronounced as taps /ɾˠ/ and /ɾʲ/ when that phoneme appears in the middle of a word adjacent to vowels on either side, or when they appear at the end of a word immediately after a vowel.\n\n\n\nVowels\n\n\nWhere two vowels appear in the chart below, they represent an unrounded and rounded pair, respectively. The back vowels except for /ɑ/ are rounded.\n\n\nOld Elven Vowels\n\n\n\n\n\nVowels\nFront\nBack\n\n\nClose\ni y\n— u\n\n\nMid\ne̞ ø̞\n— o̞\n\n\nOpen\næ\nɑ\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Elven also contrasts vowels by length. Long vowels are about double in length, and are continuous sounds.\n\n\nThe following dipthongs can appear as contrasting phonemes. Most of them are vowels followed by a close vowel, but there are three exceptions which are a close vowel followed by a different mid vowel.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiphthongs ending in /i/: /ɑi̯/, /æi̯/, /oi̯/, /ei̯/, /øi̯/, /ui̯/, /yi̯/\n\n\n\n\nDiphthongs ending in /u/: /ɑu̯/, /ou̯/, /eu̯/, /iu̯/\n\n\n\n\nDiphthongs ending in /y/: /æy̯/, /ey̯/, /øy̯/, /iy̯/\n\n\n\n\nClose-mid dipthongs: /uo̯/, /ie̯/, /yø̯/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhonotactics\n\n\nThe syllable structure follows the form (C(L))V(C). The following rules define how sounds can be placed together in words. An onset is a series of consonants that begin a syllable. A coda is a series of consonants that end a syllable. The rules define how words are built, including affixes. They do apply over compound words and in derivitional affixes. The speaker may insert a glottal stop or other vowel in boundaries inside compound words to make them easier to pronounce.\n\n\nOld Elven has a feature called ’vowel harmony’, in which the vowels in a word must be related. When words are compounded or derived, the vowels of connected words are often changed to match the harmony of the other words. This is usually the main word in derivational suffixes, but can be either in a compound word.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first syllable in a word may start with any vowel, or an onset that starts with any consonant except voiced coronal plosive or nasal (/d̪ˠ/, /dʑ/, /ŋ/, or /ɲ/).\n\n\n\n\nIf an onset ends with an obstruent (plosive, non-lateral fricative or affricate), that phoneme may be followed by a liquid (lateral or trill) that matches the previous consonant’s slender or broad category, or any vowel.\n\n\n\n\nIf an onset ends with a non-obstruent, that phoneme must be followed by any vowel.\n\n\n\n\nVowel Harmony: A word with multiple syllables must have harmonious vowels.\n\n\n\nIf the vowels /y/, /ø̞/ or /æ/ appear in a syllable, then all remaining syllables may only have the vowels /y/, /ø̞/ /æ/, /i/ or /e/.\n\n\n\n\nIf the vowels /u/, /o/, or /a/ appear in a syllable, then all remaining syllables may only have the vowels /u/, /o/, /a/, /i/ or /e/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vowel may end a word.\n\n\n\n\nA single vowel may be followed by a coda with any consonant or an onset with any consonant. This is not a real phonotactic rule. It emerges from a rule which requires that two vowels next to each other become a diphthong.\n\n\n\n\nA double or diphthong vowel may be followed by another vowel, a coda with any consonant, or an onset with any consonant.\n\n\n\n\nA coda with a coronal consonant (/t̪ˠ/, /tɕ/, /sˠ/, /ʃ/, /n̪ˠ/, /nʲ/, /rˠ/, /rʲ/, /ɫ̪/, or /lʲ/) may end a word.\n\n\n\n\nIf a vowel or coda may not end a word, it must be followed by another syllable.\n\n\n\n\nIf a syllable ends with a plosive, it may be followed by an onset with a plosive in the same place of articulation, a non-lateral fricative, a non-lateral approximant, a liquid, or a vowel.\n\n\n\n\n. If a syllable ends with a non-lateral fricative or affricate, it may be followed by an onset with any consonant or vowel.\n\n\n\n\n. If a syllable ends with a nasal, it may be followed by an onset with an obstruent or non-lateral approximant of the same place of articulation, or a vowel.\n\n\n\n\n. If a syllable ends with a liquid, it may be followed by an onset with an obstruent, non-lateral approximant, a nasal, or a vowel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthography\n\n\nOld Elven is written in a logo-syllabic script which has almost 1,000 signs. It would not be at all practical to try to replicate it here. Instead, I am providing a way to transcribe the phonemes into latin letters. This transcription makes use of diacritics (marks above or below the letters), which has the added bonus of giving the script a more unfamiliar appearance (at least for English readers).\n\n\nA second transcription is supplie for more informal text. This transcription removes diacritics where the difference in sound is indistinguishable in English. In other cases, it uses digraphs to indicate sounds that English speakers can differentiate. This informal transcription is easier to type on a US English keyboard, but may not provide accurate pronunciation.\n\n\nOld Elven
