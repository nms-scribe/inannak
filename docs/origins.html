<p><span class="chapter-flourish">The origins of the world of Inannak</span> are lost in time. Its creation is forgotten by all except perhaps some among the gods. All that remain are contradictory tales told by storytellers and cantors of the old faiths. Collected here are summaries of three myths.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-inannak"><a class="header" href="#the-creation-of-inannak">The Creation of Inannak</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Inannak means the land, the sea and the sky, and everything beyond and benath, even the planets and stars above and caverns below. Before Inannak, there was nothing. Then the darkness faded, and Inannak emerged. The stars opened in the sky as they do every cloudless evening. They shone upon the seas, which receded to reveal the land. The moons and the sun that measure our time were the last to appear.</p>
<p>--- <em>Revelations of the Apostacy, Book of the Creation, Chapter 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->
<p>The Apostacy claim the Apostate God revealed this this story to their elders long ago. In their story, Inannak had no creation, it just appeared. Soon after the emergence, beasts, plants and other living things appeared. For a long time, creatures would emerge from hidden places ready to populate the world. As each arrived, they would speak to the stars and other things of the sky, and to those who came before them, and arrange a place for themselves in it. After one million years of this, the world became lush and full of life.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-dragons"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-dragons">Cycle of the Dragons</a></h3>
<p>The last creatures to emerge upon Inannak were the dragons. When they arrived, they did not ask what their place was. They instead claimed dominion over all the creatures of Inannak.</p>
<p>The dragons of this time were even more powerful and than the dragons of today, and immortal. The story says that they were like gods themselves. These were the first thinking beings, apart from Innanak, to arrive. But there were no mortals yet, so their subjects were the animals and plants.</p>
<p>While their society was not without strife, they did not wage war. Violence only erupted in individual disputes. As today, dragons preferred to live by themselves. There were no cities, but they did build steadings to protect their livestock and possessions. The oldest ruins in the world are thought to be remnants of these steadings.</p>
<p>The dragons ruled for one hundred thousand years.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-titans"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-titans">Cycle of the Titans</a></h3>
<p>From among and beyond the stars came the primordial spirits. They did not interfere with the dragons' claim of dominion, but hid in the stars and watched. Some among these beings begat children, who were immortal giants and monsters known as titans. They saw Inannak and thought it would be better to rule there than to hide in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>The Dragon War</strong>. The titans made their claim on Inannak and fought the dragons who defended it for one thousand years. This became known as the Dragon War. The dragons saw the need for a great army, and created mortals to help in their fight. In the creation of mortals, the dragons touched mortality. Since that time, dragons are no longer immortal. Although they may live for thousands of years, they will still die, and must still have children.</p>
<p>But the masterwork of the dragons, the mortals, were their undoing. The titans knew how to control the mortals, and took them for their own armies. These armies of titans and mortals destroyed the original dragons, leaving only a few young offspring to survive in remote places.</p>
<p><strong>The First Mortals</strong>. In a contradiction of the previous story, the Revelations describe the creation of the mortals in separate verses of this cycle. The titan Ithax, when he first arrived in Inannak, created a family of ten mortals out of ten boulders he found. They were rough models and they struggled to understand who and what they were and how to survive. In disgust, Ithax turned from them, leaving them to fend for themselves. But three dragons found them and taught them how to thrive in Inannak. It was these people that the dragons nurtured into their army.</p>
<p>These first mortals were known as the elder people. Although they had two legs, two arms and a face, they were not the same as any species on Inannak today.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of the Titans</strong>. With the defeat of the dragons, the titans began their cruel rule over the creatures of Inannak. They used the mortals as both slaves and cattle. They built great citadels, some of whose ruins still remain, to rule over these mortals who lived in scattered settlements. The mortals lived in fear, but had no choice but to obey them. The titans created monsters to keep the mortals in their place, and these became their new army. It is said that when a mortal has a strange nightmare, it is a memory of this time.</p>
<p>The cycle of the titans lasted fifty thousand years.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-hebdomad"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-hebdomad">Cycle of the Hebdomad</a></h3>
<p>In the last millennia of the cycle of titans, a horrible prophecy was given to the titan Ithax. It was said that seven children would be born to him who would destroy the titans. Ithax sought out all his children and had each one put to death. But one among the children escaped before her execution, and rescued the other six. There followed a repeated series of escapes and recaptures. He finally attempted to kill them himself, but was tricked into killing seven deer instead. Still, he believed them dead.</p>
<p>While they hid, the hebdomad took the shape of mortals and lived among them. They watched their parents' power and the plight of the mortals, and agreed that something should be done. Secretly, they gathered others among their generation into an army to overthrow their elders.</p>
<p><strong>The God War</strong>. The god war lasted a thousand years, and devastated the world. When the Hebdomad defeated the titans, they banished Ithax and the most powerful of the foes back beyond the stars. The rest who survived were forced into servitude or imprisoned in remote places.</p>
<!-- -->
<p><strong>Rule of the Hebdomad</strong>. Thus began the age of the hebdomad, which is also the beginning of mortal civilization. Each of the seven gathered their favorites from among the mortals and gave them power over the other mortals. These became the first kings and emperors, and a false hope spread among the mortals that their time of fear was over. But the hebdomad instead took the place of their parents, keeping the world under their tight control. Mortals remained blinded to their captivity, as a singing bird in a cage, or an exotic beast in a menagerie. The time of the hebdomad would last ten thousand years until their destruction during the Mortal War.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-eggs"><a class="header" href="#the-four-eggs">The Four Eggs</a></h2>
<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p>Before the beginning four great eggs lay amidst the void. When these eggs hatched, they burst into showers of fire and ice which filled the void, and four great dragons emerged. These dragons were Chaamat, Behiimat, Siisat, and another which has no name. But when the dragons met each other, they fought. In the battle, the three killed the fourth one.</p>
<p>When the others saw what they had done, they mourned. Siisat flew into the sky, too angry at their siblings to face them. Behiimat dismembered the body and they and Chaamat used it and the shells of their eggs to create the world. When they were finished, Chaamat descended into the depths to mourn their shame, and Behiimat flew to the most remote land they could find. The blood of their sibling dripped from their claws, fertilizing the ground. And from that blood grew all the living things of the world: plant, beast, mortal, and lesser dragons.</p>
<p>--- <em>The Tale of the Four Eggs</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story is told by many Elven and Goblin peoples, although the details vary from telling to telling. The passage above comes from one of the more popular transcriptions of the tale. Other versions add details about the nature of the void and the eggs, or the reason for the fight between the dragons. Many versions change the nature of the conflict. One has Chaamat alone kill the fourth, as well as Siisat. Another has the fourth one be the instigator of the violence. In another, the fourth dragon is stillborn and there is no conflict.</p>
<p><strong>The First Mortals</strong>. The first mortals are always the same caste as the people who are telling the story, whether they are elves, gnomes, firbolg or goblins. They were formed in a deep cavern, their creation hidden from both Chaamat and Behiimat. But they found their world dark and barren, so they chose to search for a new home. In their search they saw spiders crawling into a tiny hole. They grabbed hold of the spiders' tiny legs and the spiders pulled them through the hole into the bright land under the sky. Here they found all manner of food and beautiful things, and most decided to stay. Some chose instead to bring the great things they found back into the caves.</p>
<p>The stories do not agree on whether non-elf peoples descended from these mortals. Some give long origin stories for peoples like the humans or the saurians, descended from these first mortals as well. Others say that those peoples were created in other places, but always after the first mortals emerged from the underworld.</p>
<p><strong>The Gods</strong>. The children of Chaamat, Behiimat and Siisat mated with the lesser dragons, with mortals, and with daimons from beyond the void. Their children conquered the living creatures of Inannak and placed the mortals under their rule. They forced all creatures to serve them, punishing without justice those who failed. From among these gods, seven eventually rose to power over all Inannak. They sought out Chaamat and Behiimat and slew them to ensure their rule was ended. They could not reach Siisat, who had flown beyond the stars.</p>
<p>From amidst the mortals they found a few who pleased them more than any other, and adopted them as their seconds. Thus arose the first high elves, and later the nobles of the other peoples. These great ones ruled over their people, enjoying the wealth and power the gods had granted them. In return they delivered punishments and rewards to the people as required by the gods to maintain order.</p>
<h2 id="the-sacred-tablets-of-ithax"><a class="header" href="#the-sacred-tablets-of-ithax">The Sacred Tablets of Ithax</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ithax created himself, and then the world. He looked out upon it and saw emptiness. He said that it would be good to fill this empty world. And so, he raised up the sky above it, and placed in it the sun, the moons and the stars. He let out a puff of air and the winds began to blow. He brought forth water and the seas filled.</p>
<p>He liked what he had created, but there was much yet to do, and he was lonely. And so he created lesser gods to help him in his tasks. Above these gods he set his eight chosen to continue the creation.</p>
<p>--- <em>The Book of Creation, Sacred Tablets of Ithax</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original sacred tablets were said to be destroyed along with the Temple of the Hebdomad. Copies of this text circulate in hidden places and are secretly read to those who still follow the hebdomad. Some copies have been obtained by libraries and are maintained for scholarly research.</p>
<p>The group of eight chosen lesser gods were called the octad. They helped him raise mountains, carve rivers and lakes, and much other detailed work. And Ithax was content with what they had done.</p>
<p>But one of the eight, who is only referred to as the eighth, grew tired of the work. They asked Ithax to create more helpers for them. For unclear reasons, Ithax found the request impertinent and grew angry. Nevertheless, he agreed and created creatures in the form of the gods, only mortal. After this final act, he left the world to watch the octad complete the creation from afar.</p>
<p>After Ithax left, the octad continued the creation as instructed. They brought forth trees, shrubs and grass on the land. They filled the seas and lakes with fish and the land and sky with beasts and birds. The mortals that Ithax created helped the eight with their work. When the creation was complete, the eight chose to rest for a time. Seven among the eight left the mortals to travel the world.</p>
<p>The mortals lived happily among the beasts in the forests. They were innocent then, and knew nothing of evil. When they were hungry or thirsty, they ate of the food given by the eight. When they were cold or tired, they hid in shelters the eight had made for them. But while the seven were elsewhere, the eighth moved among the mortals, and taught them evil. He taught them how to kill, how to steal what was not theirs, and how to live without honor to the gods.</p>
<p>When the other gods returned and saw this, they were frightened and asked Ithax what they should do. Ithax saw what had happened and became angry. He banished the eighth. The seven gods left were called the hebdomad.</p>
<p>Then he turned to the mortals and punished them. Because they had learned evil, they would now need to hunt for their food or grow it themselves. They would need to build their own shelters. And they would need to live in fear of each other, lest another mortal kill them or steal from them.</p>
<p>Ithax turned to the hebdomad and berated them for letting the eighth teach such evil. He gave them the job to watch over the mortals, and prevent evil from spreading further. He divided the mortals among them. The hebdomad would be his voice among the mortals, and teach them the right things to do. They were allowed to punish those mortals who disobeyed them and continued to follow evil.</p>
<p>The story continues on with myths of the first days of civilization, some of which coincide with known history.</p>
