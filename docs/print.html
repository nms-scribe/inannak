<p>After ten thousand years under the iron tentacles of the gods, the peoples of Inannak have finally banished their masters and freed themselves. But the the consequences of the old gods' final curse remain. Day by day the heat rises, the oceans pull away from the land, and the skies darken. Are these omens of worse to come? Will the peoples of Inannak face their demise, or can some brave heroes remove the curse or lead the people to a new world?</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="origins"><a class="header" href="#origins">Origins</a></h1>
<p>The origins of the world of Inannak are lost in time. Its creation is forgotten by all except perhaps some among the gods. All that remain are contradictory tales told by storytellers and cantors of the old faiths. Collected here are summaries of three myths.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-creation-of-inannak"><a class="header" href="#the-creation-of-inannak">The Creation of Inannak</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Inannak means the land, the sea and the air, and everything beyond, even the planets and stars. Before Inannak, there was nothing. Then the darkness faded, and Inannak emerged. The stars opened in the sky as they do every cloudless evening. They shone upon the seas, which receded to reveal the land. The moons and the sun that measure our time were the last to appear. </p>
<p>-- <em>Revelations of the Apostacy, Book of the Creation, Chapter 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apostacy claim the Apostate God revealed this this story to their elders long ago. In their story, Inannak had no creation, it just appeared. Soon after the emergence, beasts, plants and other living things became. For a long time, creatures would emerge from hidden places ready to populate the world. As each arrived, they would speak to the stars and other things of the sky, and to those who came before them, and arrange a place for themselves in it. After one million years of this, the world became lush and full of life.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-dragons"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-dragons">Cycle of the Dragons</a></h3>
<p>The last creatures to emerge upon Inannak were the dragons. When they arrived, they did not ask what their place was. They instead claimed dominion over all the creatures of Inannak.</p>
<p>The dragons of this time were even more powerful and than the dragons of today, and immortal. The story says that they were like gods themselves. These were the first thinking beings, apart from Innanak, to arrive. But there were no mortals yet, so their subjects were the animals and plants.</p>
<p>While their society was not without strife, they did not wage war. Violence only erupted in individual disputes. As today, dragons preferred to live by themselves. There were no cities, but they did build steadings to protect their livestock and possessions. The oldest ruins in the world are thought to be remnants of these steadings.</p>
<p>The dragons ruled for one hundred thousand years.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-titans"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-titans">Cycle of the Titans</a></h3>
<p>From among and beyond the stars came the primordial spirits. They did not interfere with the dragons' claim of dominion, but hid in the stars and watched. Some among these beings begat children, who were immortal giants and monsters known as titans. They saw Inannak and thought it would be better to rule there than to hide in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>The Dragon War.</strong>  The titans made their claim on Inannak and fought the dragons who defended it for one thousand years. This became known as the Dragon War. The dragons saw the need for a great army, and created mortals to help in their fight. In the creation of mortals, the dragons touched mortality. Since that time, dragons are no longer immortal. Although they may live for thousands of years, they will still die, and must still have children.</p>
<p>But the masterwork of the dragons, the mortals, were their undoing. The titans knew how to control the mortals, and took them for their own armies. These armies of titans and mortals destroyed the original dragons, leaving only a few young offspring to survive in remote places.</p>
<p><strong>The First Mortals.</strong>  In a contradiction of the previous story, the Revelations describe the creation of the mortals in separate verses of this cycle. The titan Ithax, when he first arrived in Inannak, created a family of ten mortals out of ten boulders he found. They were rough models and they struggled to understand who and what they were and how to survive. In disgust, Ithax turned from them, leaving them to fend for themselves. But three dragons found them and taught them how to thrive in Inannak. It was these people that the dragons nurtured into their army.</p>
<p>These first mortals were known as the elder people. Although they had two legs, two arms and a face, they were not the same as any peoples on Inannak today.</p>
<p><strong>Rule of the Titans.</strong>  With the defeat of the dragons, the titans began their cruel rule over the creatures of Inannak. They used the mortals as both slaves and cattle. The mortals lived in fear, but had no choice but to obey them. The titans created monsters to keep the mortals in their place, and these became their new army. It is said that when a mortal has a strange nightmare, it is a memory of this time.</p>
<p>The cycle of the titans lasted fifty thousand years.</p>
<h3 id="cycle-of-the-hebdomad"><a class="header" href="#cycle-of-the-hebdomad">Cycle of the Hebdomad</a></h3>
<p>In the last millennia of the cycle of titans, a horrible prophecy was given to the titan Ithax. It was said that seven children would be born to him who would destroy the titans. Ithax sought out all his children and had each one put to death. But one among the children escaped before her execution, and rescued the other six. There followed a repeated series of escapes and recaptures. He finally attempted to kill them himself, but was tricked into killing seven deer instead. Still, he believed them dead.</p>
<p>While they hid, the hebdomad took the shape of mortals and lived among them. They watched their parents' power and the plight of the mortals, and agreed that something should be done. Secretly, they gathered others among their generation into an army to overthrow their elders.</p>
<p><strong>The God War.</strong>  The god war lasted a thousand years, and devastated the world. When the Hebdomad defeated the titans, they banished Ithax and the most powerful of the foes back beyond the stars. The rest who survived were forced into servitude or imprisoned in remote places. </p>
<p><strong>Rule of the Hebdomad.</strong>  Thus began the age of the hebdomad, which is also the beginning of mortal civilization. Each of the seven gathered their favorites from among the mortals and gave them power over the other mortals. These became the first kings and emperors, and a false hope spread among the mortals that their time of fear was over. But the hebdomad instead took the place of their parents, keeping the world under their tight control. Mortals remained blinded to their captivity, as a singing bird in a cage, or an exotic beast in a menagerie. The time of the hebdomad would last ten thousand years until their destruction during the Mortal War.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-four-eggs"><a class="header" href="#the-four-eggs">The Four Eggs</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the beginning four great eggs lay amidst the void. When these eggs hatched, they burst into showers of fire and ice which filled the void, and four great dragons emerged. These dragons were Chaamat, Behiimat, Siisat, and another which has no name. But when the dragons met each other, they fought. The three tore the fourth one apart, scattering it's body into the void.</p>
<p>When the others saw what they had done, they mourned. Siisat flew into the sky, too angry at their siblings to face them. Behiimat dismembered the body and they and Chaamat used it and the shells of their eggs to create the world. When they were finished, Chaamat descended into the depths to mourn their shame, and Behiimat flew to the most remote land they could find. The blood of their sibling dripped from their claws, fertilizing the ground. And from that blood grew all the living things of the world: plant, beast, mortal, and lesser dragon.</p>
<p>-- <em>The Tale of the Four Eggs</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story is told by many Elven and Goblin peoples, although the details vary from telling to telling. The passage above comes from one of the more popular transcriptions of the tale. Other versions add details about the nature of the void and the eggs, or the reason for the fight between the dragons. Many versions change the nature of the conflict. One has Chaamat alone kill the fourth, as well as Siisat. Another has the fourth one be the instigator of the violence. In another, the fourth dragon is stillborn and there is no conflict.</p>
<p><strong>The First Mortals.</strong>  The first mortals are always the same caste as the people who are telling the story, whether they are elves, gnomes, firbolg or goblins. They were formed in a deep cavern, their creation hidden from both Chaamat and Behiimat. But they found their world dark and barren, so they chose to search for a new home. In their search they saw spiders crawling into a tiny hole. They grabbed hold of the spiders' tiny legs and the spiders pulled them through the hole into the bright land under the sky. Here they found all manner of food and beautiful things, and most decided to stay. Some chose instead to bring the great things they found back into the caves.</p>
<p>The stories do not agree on whether non-elf peoples descended from these mortals. Some give long origin stories for peoples like the humans or the saurians, descended from these first mortals as well. Others say that those peoples were created in other places, but always after the first mortals emerged from the underworld.</p>
<p><strong>The Gods.</strong> The children of Chaamat, Behiimat and Siisat mated with the lesser dragons, with mortals, and with celestials from beyond the void. Their children conquered the living creatures of Inannak and placed the mortals under their rule. They forced all creatures to serve them, punishing without justice those who failed. From among these gods, seven eventually rose to power over all Inannak. They sought out Chaamat and Behiimat and slew them to ensure their constant rule. They could not reach Siisat, who had flown beyond the stars.</p>
<p>From amidst the mortals they found a few who pleased them more than any other, and adopted them as their seconds. Thus arose the first high elves, and later the nobles of the other peoples. These great ones ruled over their people, enjoying the wealth and power the gods had granted them. In return they delivered punishments and rewards to the people as required by the gods to maintain order.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-sacred-tablets-of-ithax"><a class="header" href="#the-sacred-tablets-of-ithax">The Sacred Tablets of Ithax</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ithax created himself, and then the world. He looked out upon it and saw emptiness. He said that it would be good to fill this empty world. And so, he raised up the sky above it, and placed in it the sun, the moons and the stars. He let out a puff of air and the winds began to blow. He brought forth water and the seas filled.</p>
<p>He liked what he had created, but there was much yet to do, and he was lonely. And so he created lesser gods to help him in his tasks. Above these gods he set his eight chosen to continue the creation.</p>
<p>-- <em>The Book of Creation, Sacred Tablets of Ithax</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original sacred tablets were destroyed along with the Temple of the Hebdomad. Copies of the text circulate in hidden places and are secretly read to those who still follow the hebdomad. Some copies have been obtained by libraries and are maintained for scholarly research.</p>
<p>The group of eight chosen lesser gods were called the octad. They helped him raise mountains, carve rivers and lakes, and much other detailed work. And Ithax was content with what they had done.</p>
<p>But one of the eight, who is only referred to as the eighth, grew tired of the work. They asked Ithax to create more helpers for them. For unclear reasons, Ithax found the request impertinent and grew angry. Nevertheless, he agreed and created creatures in the form of the gods, only mortal. After this final act, he left the world to watch the octad complete the creation from afar.</p>
<p>After Ithax left, the octad continued the creation as instructed. They brought forth trees, shrubs and grass on the land. They filled the seas and lakes with fish and the land and sky with beasts and birds. The mortals that Ithax created helped the eight with their work. When the creation was complete, the eight chose to rest for a time. Seven among the eight left the mortals to travel the world. </p>
<p>The mortals lived happily among the beasts in the forests. They were innocent then, and knew nothing of evil. When they were hungry or thirsty, they ate of the food given by the eight. When they were cold or tired, they hid in shelters the eight had made for them. But while the seven were elsewhere, the eighth moved among the mortals, and taught them evil. He taught them how to kill, how to steal what was not theirs, and how to live without honor to the gods.</p>
<p>When the other gods returned and saw this, they were frightened and asked Ithax what they should do. Ithax saw what had happened and became angry. He banished the eighth. The seven gods left were called the hebdomad. </p>
<p>Then he turned to the mortals and punished them. Because they had learned evil, they would now need to hunt for their food or grow it themselves. They would need to build their own shelters. And they would need to live in fear of each other, lest another mortal kill them or steal from them.</p>
<p>Ithax turned to the hebdomad and berated them for letting the eighth teach such evil. He gave them the job to watch over the mortals, and prevent evil from spreading further. He divided the mortals among them. The hebdomad would be his voice among the mortals, and teach them the right things to do. They were allowed to punish those mortals who disobeyed them and continued to follow evil.</p>
<p>The story continues on with myths of the first days of civilization, some of which coincide with known history.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-hebdomad"><a class="header" href="#the-hebdomad">The Hebdomad</a></h1>
<p>Whatever their true origins are, the hebdomad ruled over Inannak from the dawn of time to about three hundred years ago. The hebdomad is an ancient word that means &quot;group of seven&quot;, as that was their number. They ruled among the mortals, claiming to be the voice and hands of someone greater. The Ithaxists called this greater god Ithax, but there is no historical record outside of their scriptures which names this greater god.</p>
<p>The hebdomad were never the only gods. There were many lesser gods who obeyed them. According to some myths a few greater, but they do not interfere with the world. There are also gods unnassociated with them, such as the dragon gods, who nevertheless left the hebdomad alone to rule mortals.</p>
<p>Each of the hebdomad claimed some domain as a focus of their power. These domains merely describe their patronage, powers and preferred methods of rule, not their job. They were not in charge of maintaining those domains. Nor did they expect their chosen mortals to focus on these same domains. While some of the domains were positive, many domains also came with their opposites, hate for love, disease for medicine, etc. The gods were masters of those as well.</p>
<p>Each of the hebdomad were also associated with an astronomical body. Many of their names are the same as the names of those bodies in some languages. But the hebdomad did not live in these places in the skies, but in palaces among mortals.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the power and appearance of the gods below come from traditional sources. Many of these sources have good reason to exaggerate, whether the bias was towards them or the heroes who slew them. The hebdomad may have been closer to mortals in their power than is evident from this knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="atton"><a class="header" href="#atton">Atton</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Medicine, life, divination, music, poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Astonomy:</strong> The sun, although no language connects his name with that. Some scholars believe this association is merely due to process of elimination and his associated color.</p>
<p>Atton called himself Lord of Music and Medicine. In his deific form, he was a figure of burning flame. In mortal form he was known for his beautiful golden skin and blonde hair. It was said that subjects who saw him became so struck by that beauty that they could not disobey their commands. Atton was known to maintain his smile and humor even as he meted out horrible pain to his dissenters. None could know if they had gained Atton's approval or disapproval until the moment the punishment came. Sometimes those punishments appeared to be rewards at first, only showing his malevolence as the recipient began to reap the painful consequences.</p>
<p>As a god of music and poetry, Atton would give concerts and recitals outside his golden palace to all who would attend. Often, special invitations were given to honored guests. Those who attended these concerts would hear his beautiful words and their bonds to Atton would be strengthened. Few could leave these concerts without feeling a profound sense of honor at having witnessed it.</p>
<p>As god of medicine and life, Alton had a deep understanding of the body. He was known to be expert at healing any disease and fixing any wound. With the flick of the hand, Atton could heal the patients in an entire hospital, or destroy the vital organs of an army. In the Mortal War, Atton used their powers to raise armies of dead to destroy the Apostacy. He was destroyed by being tricked into submersing himself in the lava pits of Mount Inferno.</p>
<p>Atton was the patron of the Orghu peoples. </p>
<h2 id="oria"><a class="header" href="#oria">Oria</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Hunting, weaponry, nature, animals and plants.</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The greater moon</p>
<p>Oria was said to be the favored elder sister of Atton, calling herself Lady of the Bow. In deific form, she had a human body with a wolf's head and falcon's wings. In mortal form she was known for shining silver skin and hair. Her skin was said to reflect like a mirror. Any who saw her could also see themselves on her skin surrounded by a glamour that showed how she saw them. Unlike her sibling, she never smiled, and her punishments and rewards came with the same expression.</p>
<p>As a god of hunting, she was an expert at tracking. As a god of weaponry, she was an expert at any bow, sword, spear or pole-arm. She even held and gave to her armies unique weapons that she had created herself. During the Mortal War, she was said to have created weapons that could shoot around corners and fly miles away and still hit their target. She was killed by a weapon of her own invention, that she had created to kill the one known as the Apostate God.</p>
<p>Oria was the patron of the human peoples. </p>
<h2 id="eilwain"><a class="header" href="#eilwain">Eilwain</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Knowledge, craft, art, magic.</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The lesser moon</p>
<p>Eilwain was called &quot;She Who Knows&quot;. Her deific form was never recorded, she was said to wear long robes with deep cowls. Her sleeves were said to appear empty even as she held things in unseen hands. In her mortal form she was an elderly woman who wore a black cloth over her eyes, although she was not known to be blind.</p>
<p>As god of knowledge, Eilwain was said to know any idea a mortal could have before it was even spoken or written. She is said to have invented writing to record this knowledge. Many fabled tomes are attributed to her own writing. Often these tomes are known as hiding deeper knowledge hidden by code or puzzles, or containing a curse on mortals who read them.</p>
<p>As god of craft and magic, she was known for creating devices both miraculous and infernal, which no mortal could ever discern the true workings of. With little thought, she could find weak points and disable any complex device, or shatter some structure. She created an army of constructs to serve and protect her during the Mortal War. Eilwain destroyed herself when she was put in a situation where the only possible outcome she could find was her own death.</p>
<p>Eilwain was the patron of the Thri-Kreen.</p>
<h2 id="astaffe"><a class="header" href="#astaffe">Astaffe</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Love, desire, greed, lust, fertility.</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The first planet, &quot;the blue one&quot;.</p>
<p>Astaffe was called the Gentle One, although ironically, and the Formless One. They were not recorded as woman or man, but would appear in a different form every time they were seen. Nor were they known to have a separate deific and mortal form.</p>
<p>As a god of love and desire, Astaffe could convince any mortal to do her bidding with kind words and acts. Often these biddings would be revealed later as beneficial to Astaffe alone. They could create connections among mortals to fit their needs. They could turn enemies into friends and friends into enemies. </p>
<p>As god of fertility, Astaffe could cause fields and forests to grow or turn barren. In the Mortal War they blocked the paths of the apostates with thick forests full of multitudes of insects and other pests. One such forest was grown in the dismal swamp of Peghro, where she hid in her last days. Astaffe was killed by the mortal hero half-elf, Tijhändreu Mei, who struggled for days through the tangled brush to find the god. </p>
<p>Astaffe was the patron of the Shirrwern peoples.</p>
<h2 id="sabowth"><a class="header" href="#sabowth">Sabowth</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> War, struggle, destruction, travel, water</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The second planet, &quot;the red one&quot;.</p>
<p>Sabowth was called the War King. His mortal and deific forms were the same. He appeared as a prepubescent boy with horns. In some legends, his behavior mimicked that of a spoiled child. But this was not the story formula of the spoiled child getting punished, Sabowth usually got his way.  Sabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Ildabowth.</p>
<p>As god of war, Sabowth was a master tactician and strategist. When he set to the field, he rarely lost a battle except due to interference from other gods. He could pick out the enemies weaknesses and exploit them with precision. His greatest strength was his knowledge of the ways and his ability to move armies and their support along the fastest routes. This allowed his domain to overlap with travel, where he was often known as the Wanderer.</p>
<p>After the God War, as the others in the hebdomad divided the world into parts, Sabowth saw saw the oceans and fresh waters remained unclaimed. Seeing how much there was out there, he made his own claim to them. Thus he also claims power over the ocean winds, currents and waves, as well as the depths below and what lives there. Thus he was master of navies as well as armies. He was lord of the monsters which thrive in the sea, and used these creatures to aid his navy in the Mortal War.</p>
<p>Sabowth could not be killed through strategy. Nor could he be killed by numbers, as he always had a fallback plan. While some tried these steps, they did not succeed. Instead, Sabowth was captured and chained by his own soldiers, who had grown tired of the war and joined the apostacy in secret. He was then banished beyond the stars by seventeen mortal wizards and a dragon.</p>
<p>Sabowth was patron of the Äľveen and the Sea Peoples.</p>
<h2 id="eow"><a class="header" href="#eow">Eow</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Sky, weather</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The third planet, &quot;the white one&quot;</p>
<p>Eow itself is a word for the sky in one human tongue, it is apparent that Eow's real name is not spoken. In her deific form, she had a humanoid body with stork legs and seven snake heads. In mortal form, she was a powerful middle-aged woman with thick, dark hair. She was known for the great staff she carried, with which she was said to create lightning and call storms.</p>
<p>As god of the sky and weather, Eow possibly had more power than any of the other gods. She could call rains, wind, lightning and other forces of nature, as well as clear out the clouds and calm the winds. Thus she could bring rain or drought to farmers, and foul or fair travel to sailors. When she went to the field during the Mortal War, one could guarantee that the weather would be bad.</p>
<p>While Eow did not claim any godly domain of politics, leadership or law, she was a master at all. She manipulated the politics of the mortal world throughout the age of the hebdomad. She was said to play royalty and nobles like pawns in a game. She was called by the other gods in cases where they need arbitration. She was also the chief of the council of the hebdomad. This did not mean she was the leader of the hebdomad, but that she kept order in their meetings and discussions and often had the final say in decisions.</p>
<p>None know how Eow was killed. Her death was discovered by servants one morning in her palace while her armies were on the march to battle. The room she lay in had been sealed shut to the outside and her guards remained undisturbed by all doors and shutters. Although she had been stabbed, there was no sign of the weapons used to do so.</p>
<p>Eow was the patron of Saurian peoples.</p>
<h2 id="ildabowth"><a class="header" href="#ildabowth">Ildabowth</a></h2>
<p><strong>Domains:</strong> Agriculture, death, underworld, minerals, wealth</p>
<p><strong>Astronomy:</strong> The fourth planet, &quot;the yellow one&quot;</p>
<p>Ildabowth was called Emperor of the Underworld, and this term referred both to the world after death as well as the world below the ground. In his deific form, he had a humanoid body with the head of a bull and arms ending in scythe blades. In his mortal form, he was an elder man with a thick beard and hair, and fine, noble clothes. Ildabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Sabowth.</p>
<p>Much like his brother Sabowth, Ildabowth saw unclaimed opportunity when the rest of the hebdomad divided the world among them. Ildabowth laid claim to all things underground, and everything that underground symbolized, even death. Through this claim he also claimed the minerals taken from the ground, the crops that rose from them, and the labor required to retrieve this wealth. He ran his dominions as a foreman would run a factory or a merchant would run his trade.</p>
<p>Ildabowth was the first to fall in the Mortal War, early on. He was killed after the apostacy began to spread among his people. Their rise in rebellion initiated the Mortal War, and their execution of Ildabowth convinced the other mortals that the war could be successful.</p>
<p>Ildabowth was the patron of the Gnoles.</p>
<h2 id="the-apostate-god"><a class="header" href="#the-apostate-god">The Apostate God</a></h2>
<p>While likely not a part of the hebdomad, the apostate god was the anonymous deity who initiated the apostacy and led to the end of the hebdomad. This deity was said to have revealed truth to the first apostates, and lent inspiration and weapons to the rebels during the mortal war. The apostacy grew in secrecy, and obfuscated much of their knowledge and activities to avoid detection and protect each other. Thus most of the interactions with the apostate god were not recorded. The only recordings known are the story of the deity's revelations to the first apostacists, and four interactions corroborated by different biased sources during the Mortal War. The last such interaction records the death of the apostate god in battle with the hebdomad.</p>
<p>There could be many untold beings in the universe who could hold the mantle of the apostate god. Or perhaps the being was made up by the apostacy to support their beliefs and cause. The truth may never be known. However, there are at least three popular theories of the Apostate God's identity.</p>
<p><strong>Members of the Hebdomad.</strong> In this theory, the hebdomad themselves unwittingly supported the apostacy. The general consensus for this theory attributes it to two of them: Eilwain and Oria. The revelations of the apostacy were found hidden in tomes that Eilwain had written, and this knowledge was spread slowly throughout. When the rebellions began, the apostacy initiated a small counter-rebellion who believed they were fighting for the hebdomad. This counter-rebellion was sent to Oria for aid, and she provided them weapons. When they asked for a weapon that would help them hunt and kill the apostate god, a being Oria herself had been frustrated in hunting, she gave them such a powerful weapon. This was then delivered into the hands of the apostacy, and used in as many as three of the deaths of the hebdomad.</p>
<p><strong>A Child of the Hebdomad.</strong> A popular legend tells the tale of a child who was born to, or sired by, one of the hebdomad and a mortal. The identity of the parent differs in various tellings. In this legend, the child grew up jealous of their parent. At first, they sought to follow the same path as their parents (as told by the apostacy), gathering fellow gods to fight their parents and take over with a new generation. But they then saw a scene of horrible mortal suffering, perhaps the spread of a disease, or the execution of a village. This scene convinced them that there could not be a new generation of gods, and that the mortals had to take the world from the gods themselves. From their this god began to gather and teach mortals, the first apostates, and reveal the truth as they knew it.</p>
<p><strong>The Eighth.</strong> The followers of the Temple of Ithax, whom they know as father of the hebdomad, spoke of an eighth child who was banished by Ithax before he moved beyond the stars. It is their belief that the apostate god was the one known as the eighth, who had somehow contacted the first apostates and led them onto the wrong path. The historian Jildas of Leth  suggests that although this idea is tainted by the Ithaxian beliefs, there may indeed have been another god of similar power to the hebdomad. Such a god could have been banished by the hebdomad, and would then have a vengeful motive to provide aid to the mortals.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="old-elven"><a class="header" href="#old-elven">Old Elven</a></h1>
<p>Old Elven (Äľveen /ælʲβʲe̞ːnʲ/) is a classical language originally spoken in the ancient Elven Dominion, and is used as a literary, scriptural or legal language in some lands. It is the proto-language for numerous modern Elven and Goblin dialects.</p>
<p>The language is an aggultinative and synthetic language. Combinations of prefixes and suffixes are added to roots to form words. In Old Elven, each change in category such as gender, person, number, or tense is handled by a different affix, whereas in an inflective language, which the reader may be more famliar with, a single affix might be used to indicate a single combination of all of those.</p>
<p>Word order in Old Elven is generally subject-object-verb, and adjectives come after nouns. The language recognizes makes use of four genders: female, male, animate neutral and inanimate neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> <em>Old Elven is described here for use in building single words such as proper nouns for personal use. It is not intended to be a spoken or literary language, and thus the grammar is not described.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="phonology"><a class="header" href="#phonology">Phonology</a></h2>
<p>Stress is always on the second to last syllable of the word.</p>
<h3 id="consonants"><a class="header" href="#consonants">Consonants</a></h3>
<p>In addition to typical classifications, Old Elven has a broad and slender contrast to most consonants. A broad consonant is generally velarized and labialized if the consonant isn't already labial, before a front vowel. Velarized means that the back of the tongue is raised during pronunciation. This results in a slight 'w' sound as the consonant ends. Similarly, a slender consonant is generally palatialized before a back vowel, resulting in a slight 'y' sound. </p>
<p>In the below chart, when two consonants appear, the first is broad and the second slender.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Consonants</th><th>Labial</th><th>Coronal</th><th>Dorsal</th><th>Glottal</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Plosive   - voiceless</td><td>pˠ pʲ</td><td>t̪ˠ</td><td>k c</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Plosive   - voiced</td><td>bˠ bʲ</td><td>d̪ˠ</td><td>ɡ ɟ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fricative - voiceless</td><td>ɸˠ ɸʲ</td><td>sˠ ʃ</td><td>x ç</td><td>h</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fricative - voiced</td><td>βˠ βʲ</td><td></td><td>ɣ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Affricate - voiceless</td><td></td><td>  tɕ</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Affricate - voiced</td><td></td><td>  dʑ</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Approximant - voiced</td><td></td><td></td><td>  j</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Nasal</td><td>mˠ mʲ</td><td>n̪ˠ nʲ</td><td>ŋ ɲ</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Trill</td><td></td><td>rˠ rʲ</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Lateral fricative</td><td></td><td>ɫ̪</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Lateral approximant</td><td></td><td>  lʲ</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Voiceless stops are generally aspirated, unless they occur after a fricative or at the end of a word. The labial fricatives are bilabial, not labiodental. The coronal stops and the broad nasal are dental, not alveolar.</p>
<p>The slender equivalent to the coronal stops (/t̪ˠ/ and /d̪ˠ/) are affricates (/tɕ/ and /dʑ/), just as the slender version of the voiceless coronal fricative is a palatal fricative /ʃ/. In a related shift, the dorsal voice fricative becomes the approximant /j/. However, the /j/ has an allophone of  /ʝ/ (voiced /ç/) at the end of a syllable when not word-final. Using a similar pattern, the dorsal consonants are not velarized or palatalized, but the consonants shift position towards velar or palatal instead. The glottal consonant does not have a broad or slender form. The broad /l/ is a voiceless lateral fricative.</p>
<p>The trills /rˠ/ and /rʲ/ are pronounced as taps /ɾˠ/ and /ɾʲ/ when that phoneme appears in the middle of a word adjacent to vowels on either side, or when they appear at the end of a word immediately after a vowel.</p>
<h3 id="vowels"><a class="header" href="#vowels">Vowels</a></h3>
<p>Where two vowels appear in the chart below, they represent an unrounded and rounded pair, respectively. The back vowels except for /ɑ/ are rounded.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Vowels</th><th>Front</th><th>Back</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Close</td><td>i y</td><td>  u</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mid</td><td>e̞ ø̞</td><td>  o̞</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open</td><td>æ</td><td>ɑ</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Old Elven also contrasts vowels by length. Long vowels are about double in length, and are continuous sounds.</p>
<p>The following dipthongs can appear as contrasting phonemes. Most of them are vowels followed by a close vowel, but there are three exceptions which are a close vowel followed by a different mid vowel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diphthongs ending in /i/: /ɑi̯/, /æi̯/, /oi̯/, /ei̯/, /øi̯/, /ui̯/, /yi̯/ </li>
<li>Diphthongs ending in /u/: /ɑu̯/, /ou̯/, /eu̯/, /iu̯/ </li>
<li>Diphthongs ending in /y/: /æy̯/, /ey̯/, /øy̯/, /iy̯/</li>
<li>Close-mid dipthongs: /uo̯/, /ie̯/, /yø̯/</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="phonotactics"><a class="header" href="#phonotactics">Phonotactics</a></h3>
<p>The syllable structure follows the form (C(L))V(C). The following rules define how sounds can be placed together in words. An onset is a series of consonants that begin a syllable. A coda is a series of consonants that end a syllable. The rules define how words are built, including affixes. They do apply over compound words and in derivitional affixes. The speaker may insert a glottal stop or other vowel in boundaries inside compound words to make them easier to pronounce. </p>
<p>Old Elven has a feature called 'vowel harmony', in which the vowels in a word must be related. When words are compounded or derived, the vowels of connected words are often changed to match the harmony of the other words. This is usually the main word in derivational suffixes, but can be either in a compound word.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first syllable in a word may start with any vowel, or an onset that starts with any consonant except voiced coronal plosive or nasal (/d̪ˠ/, /dʑ/, /ŋ/, or /ɲ/).</li>
<li>If an onset ends with an obstruent (plosive, non-lateral fricative or affricate), that phoneme may be followed by a liquid (lateral or trill) that matches the previous consonant's slender or broad category, or any vowel.</li>
<li>If an onset ends with a non-obstruent, that phoneme <em>must</em> be followed by any vowel.</li>
<li><strong>Vowel Harmony:</strong> A word with multiple syllables must have harmonious vowels. 
a. If the vowels /y/, /ø̞/ or /æ/ appear in a syllable, then all remaining syllables may only have the vowels /y/, /ø̞/ /æ/, /i/ or /e/. 
b. If the vowels /u/, /o/, or /a/ appear in a syllable, then all remaining syllables may only have the vowels /u/, /o/, /a/, /i/ or /e/. </li>
<li>A vowel may end a word.</li>
<li>A single vowel may be followed by a coda with any consonant or an onset with any consonant. <em>This is not a real phonotactic rule. It emerges from a rule which requires that two vowels next to each other become a diphthong.</em></li>
<li>A double or diphthong vowel may be followed by another vowel, a coda with any consonant, or an onset with any consonant.</li>
<li>A coda with a coronal consonant (/t̪ˠ/, /tɕ/, /sˠ/, /ʃ/, /n̪ˠ/, /nʲ/, /rˠ/, /rʲ/, /ɫ̪/, or /lʲ/) may end a word.</li>
<li>If a vowel or coda may not end a word, it must be followed by another syllable.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a plosive, it may be followed by an onset with a plosive in the same place of articulation, a non-lateral fricative, a non-lateral  approximant, a liquid, or a vowel.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a non-lateral fricative or affricate, it may be followed by an onset with any consonant or vowel.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a nasal, it may be followed by an onset with an obstruent or non-lateral approximant of the same place of articulation, or a vowel.</li>
<li>If a syllable ends with a liquid, it may be followed by an onset with an obstruent, non-lateral approximant, a nasal, or a vowel.</li>
</ol>

<p>Old Elven is written in a logo-syllabic script which has almost 1,000 signs. It would not be at all practical to try to replicate it here. Instead, I am providing a way to transcribe the phonemes into latin letters. This transcription makes use of diacritics (marks above or below the letters), which has the added bonus of giving the script a more unfamiliar appearance (at least for English readers). </p>
<p>A second transcription is supplie for more informal text. This transcription removes diacritics where the difference in sound is indistinguishable in English. In other cases, it uses digraphs to indicate sounds that English speakers can differentiate. This informal transcription is easier to type on a US English keyboard, but may not provide accurate pronunciation.</p>
