<h1 class="ltx_title ltx_title_chapter">Chapter 4: The Hebdomad</h1>

<div id="p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Whatever their true origins are, the hebdomad ruled over Inannak from the dawn of time to about three hundred years ago. The hebdomad is an ancient word that means ”group of seven”, as that was their number. They ruled among the mortals, claiming to be the voice and hands of someone greater. The Ithaxians called this greater god Ithax, but there is no historical record outside their scriptures which names this greater god.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The hebdomad were never the only gods. There were many lesser gods who obeyed them. According to some myths a few greater, but they do not interfere with the world. There are also gods unassociated with them, such as the dragon gods, who nevertheless left the hebdomad alone to rule mortals.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Each of the hebdomad claimed some domain as a focus of their power. These domains merely describe their patronage, powers and preferred methods of rule, not their job. They were not in charge of maintaining those domains. Nor did they expect their chosen mortals to focus on these same domains. While some domains were positive, many domains also came with their opposites, hate for love, disease for medicine, etc. The gods were masters of those as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Each of the hebdomad were also associated with an astronomical body. Many of their names are the same as the names of those bodies in some languages. But the hebdomad did not live in these places in the skies, but in palaces among mortals.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The descriptions of the power and appearance of the gods below come from traditional sources. Many of these sources have good reason to exaggerate, whether the bias was towards them or the heroes who slew them. The hebdomad may have been closer to mortals in their power than is evident from this knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Yes, this is almost all from Wikipedia research, which is acceptable since this is fantasy and I’m just making up names.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Once I’d found the names, I gave them the old Anglicization routine, which allows me to change the spelling while still retaining some semblance of the pronunciation.</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The personalities are borrowed from the Greek Gods, partly by relating them to Solar planets and then getting their associated gods. However, I had to play around with these, since I wanted equal female and male, and some important gods (Hades, Hekate and Poseidon) weren’t represented. –¿</p>

In mortal form she was known for shining silver skin and hair. Her skin was said to reflect like a mirror. Any who saw her could also see themselves on her skin surrounded by a glamour that showed how she saw them.

She even held and gave to her armies unique weapons that she had created herself. During the Mortal War, she was said to have created weapons that could shoot around corners and fly miles away and still hit their target. She was killed by a weapon of her own invention, that she had created to kill the one known as the Apostate God.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">As god of knowledge, Eilwain was said to know any idea a mortal could have before it was even spoken or written. She is said to have invented writing to record this knowledge. Many fabled tomes are attributed to her own writing. Often these tomes are known as hiding deeper knowledge hidden by code or puzzles, or containing a curse on mortals who read them.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">As god of craft and magic, she was known for creating devices both miraculous and infernal, which no mortal could ever discern the true workings of. With little thought, she could find weak points and disable any complex device, or shatter some structure. She created an army of constructs to serve and protect her during the Mortal War.

It was said that subjects who saw him became so struck by that beauty that they could not disobey their commands. Atton was known to maintain his smile and humor even as he meted out horrible pain to his dissenters. None could know if they had gained Atton’s approval or disapproval until the moment the punishment came. Sometimes those punishments appeared to be rewards at first, only showing his malevolence as the recipient began to reap the painful consequences.</p>

Those who attended these concerts would hear his beautiful words and their bonds to Atton would be strengthened.

In the Mortal War, Atton used their powers to raise armies of dead to destroy the Apostasy. He was destroyed by being tricked into submersing himself in the lava pits of Mount Inferno.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Sabowth was called the War King. His mortal and deific forms were the same. He appeared as a prepubescent boy with horns. In some legends, his behavior mimicked that of a spoiled child. But this was not the story formula of the spoiled child getting punished, Sabowth usually got his way. Sabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Ildabowth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">As god of war, Sabowth was a master tactician and strategist. When he set to the field, he rarely lost a battle except due to interference from other gods. He could pick out the enemies weaknesses and exploit them with precision. His greatest strength was his knowledge of the ways and his ability to move armies and their support along the fastest routes. This allowed his domain to overlap with travel, where he was often known as the Wanderer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">After the God War, as the others in the hebdomad divided the world into parts, Sabowth saw the oceans and fresh waters remained unclaimed. Seeing how much there was out there, he made his own claim to them. Thus, he also claims power over the ocean winds, currents and waves, as well as the depths below and what lives there. He was master of navies as well as armies. He was lord of the monsters which thrive in the sea, and used these creatures to aid his navy in the Mortal War.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Sabowth could not be killed through strategy. Nor could he be killed by numbers, as he always had a fallback plan. While some tried these steps, they did not succeed. Instead, Sabowth was captured and chained by his own soldiers, who had grown tired of the war and joined the apostasy in secret. He was then banished beyond the stars by seventeen mortal wizards and a dragon.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Eow itself is a word for the sky in one human tongue, it is apparent that Eow’s real name is not spoken. In her deific form, she had a humanoid body with stork legs and seven snake heads. In mortal form, she was a powerful middle-aged woman with thick, dark hair. She was known for the great staff she carried, with which she was said to create lightning and call storms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">As god of the sky and weather, Eow possibly had more power than any of the other gods. She could call rains, wind, lightning and other forces of nature, as well as clear out the clouds and calm the winds. She could bring rain or drought to farmers, and foul or fair travel to sailors. When she went to the field during the Mortal War, one could guarantee that the weather would be bad.</p>

<div id="S6.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">While Eow did not claim any godly domain of politics, leadership or law, she was a master at all. She manipulated the politics of the mortal world throughout the age of the hebdomad, and played royalty and nobles like pawns in a game. She was called by the other gods in cases where they need arbitration. Eow was also the chief of the council of the hebdomad. This did not mean she was the leader of the hebdomad, but that she kept order in their meetings and discussions and often had the final say in decisions.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Ildabowth was called Emperor of the Underworld, and this term referred both to the world after death and the world below the ground. In his deific form, he had a humanoid body with the head of a bull and arms ending in scythe blades. In his mortal form, he was an elder man with a thick beard and hair, and fine, noble clothes. Ildabowth was born at the same time from the same mother as Sabowth.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Much like his brother Sabowth, Ildabowth saw unclaimed opportunity when the rest of the hebdomad divided the world among them. Ildabowth laid claim to all things underground, and everything that underground symbolized, even death. Through this claim he also claimed the minerals taken from the ground, the crops that rose from them, and the labor required to retrieve this wealth. He ran his dominions as a foreman would run a factory or a merchant would run his trade.</p>

<div id="S7.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p3" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">Ildabowth was the first to fall in the Mortal War, early on. He was killed after the apostasy began to spread among his people. Their rise in rebellion initiated the Mortal War, and their execution of Ildabowth convinced the other mortals that the war could be successful.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">The Apostate God</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">While likely not a part of the hebdomad, the apostate god was the anonymous deity who initiated the apostasy and led to the end of the hebdomad. This deity was said to have revealed truth to the first apostates, and lent inspiration and weapons to the rebels during the mortal war. The apostasy grew in secrecy, and obfuscated much of their knowledge and activities to avoid detection and protect each other. Most of the interactions with the apostate god were not recorded. The only recordings known are the story of the deity’s revelations to the first apostacists, and four interactions corroborated by different biased sources during the Mortal War. The last such interaction records the death of the apostate god in battle with the hebdomad.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">There could be many untold beings in the universe who could hold the mantle of the apostate god. Or perhaps the being was made up by the apostasy to support their beliefs and cause. The truth may never be known. However, there are at least three popular theories of the Apostate God’s identity.</p>
</div>
<section id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1" class="ltx_paragraph">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">Members of the Hebdomad</h3>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px1.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">In this theory, the hebdomad themselves unwittingly supported the apostasy. The consensus for this theory attributes it to two of them: Eilwain and Oria. The revelations of the apostasy were found hidden in tomes that Eilwain had written, and this knowledge was spread slowly throughout. When the rebellions began, the apostasy initiated a small counter-rebellion who believed they were fighting for the hebdomad. This counter-rebellion was sent to Oria for aid, and she provided them weapons. When they asked for a weapon that would help them hunt and kill the apostate god, a being Oria herself had been frustrated in hunting, she gave them such a powerful weapon. This was then delivered into the hands of the apostasy, and used in as many as three of the deaths of the hebdomad.</p>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">A popular legend tells the tale of a child who was born to, or raised by, one of the hebdomad and a mortal. The identity of the parent differs in various tellings. In this legend, the child grew up jealous of their parent. At first, they sought to follow the same path as their parents (as told by the apostasy), gathering fellow gods to fight their parents and take over with a new generation. But they then saw a scene of horrible mortal suffering, perhaps the spread of a disease, or the execution of a village. This scene convinced them that there could not be a new generation of gods, and that the mortals had to take the world from the gods themselves. From their this god began to gather and teach mortals, the first apostates, and reveal the truth as they knew it.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_paragraph">The Eighth</h3>

<div id="S8.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p class="ltx_p">The followers of the Temple of Ithax, whom they know as father of the hebdomad, spoke of an eighth child who was banished by Ithax before he moved beyond the stars. It is their belief that the apostate god was the one known as the eighth, who had somehow contacted the first apostates and led them onto the wrong path. The historian Jildas of Leth suggests that although this idea is tainted by the Ithaxian beliefs, there may indeed have been another god of similar power to the hebdomad. Such a god could have been banished by the hebdomad, and would then have a vengeful motive to provide aid to the mortals. </p>
